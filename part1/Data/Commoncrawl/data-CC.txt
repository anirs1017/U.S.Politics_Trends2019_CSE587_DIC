It's also EXPLOITATIVE. It is 1/3 of what farmers need to live with dignity. You, like your voters, have been deceived by "Fairtrade"http://bit.ly/2C8iOYf  It's CRUEL & UNACCEPTABLE that @Eleanor_SmithMP writes that women in the cocoa (coffee & tea) supply chain of the UK (& EU) "could live a decent life" with £1.86/day.

Important @thehill piece by my predecessor, the former @OxfamAmerica president @roffenheiser & Tom Hare on the moral shame of ending aid to Central America.https://thehill.com/opinion/international/437537-ending-assistance-to-central-america-is-morally-shameful … I was pleased to speak at the University of Central America in San Salvador @UCA_ES on challenges to #humanrights, justice, and #migration.

Now is not the time to cut support to programs working to end the cycle of violence driving #migration./6pic.twitter.com/rUpf6wghrN At the Santa Maria school, I met inspiring students who benefiting from programs designed to ensure safe school environments and ensure youth can grow and develop.

 Please note – our sizes are true to size. The medium will be a true medium and not a smallish-medium, like some companies. The sizes are also true to most average underwear garments, so if you normally buy a large in underwear that is the size you should buy from Play Out underwear. Our Boxer Brief, Bikini and Thong underwear feature a flat-fronted cut. It does not provide compression or hold.  Our Pouch Underwear, the Trunk, Pouch Bikini and Pouch Thong, feature a pouch-style front with extra fabric space for equipment and no opening. Please refer to the "More Info" tab on each product to see additional fit notes depending on underwear style.  Please note Tank Tops sizes run on the smaller side. All original Play Out fabric tank tops (prints) run cropped, on the shorter side.

We've detected that JavaScript is disabled in your browser. Would you like to proceed to legacy Twitter? Yes Rootless Cosmopolitan. No Country For Young Men. Turkish Journalist and Political Analyst. Byline and Quotes: @BBC @HuffPost @TGlobePost @washingtonpost Are you sure you want to view these Tweets? Viewing Tweets won't unblock @abyasun And the sad thing was that this mob attack took place in the heart of the country, in Ankara, in Turkey's capital, in front of Defense Minister and other senior government figures. Abdullah Ayasun Retweeted Sezgin Tanrıkulu With this comment, Turkey's Defense Minister legitimizes and justifies the attack against @kilicdarogluk. "Dear citizens you protested, you sent your message, now calm down." Could an assault/attack be seen as a normal message? What kind of logic is this?https://twitter.com/MSTanrikulu/status/1119961395179728897 … Abdullah Ayasun added, The CHP leader was in an armed vehicle for protection. The crowd was still trying attack while antiriot police inefficiently tried to disperse them. Normally, the police were much more effective, use tear gas to break up a protest (if held) by government opponents. Abdullah Ayasun Retweeted Muhalif Ç. Only special police forces were able to bring main opposition CHP Chairman @kilicdarogluk into safety through the pro-government crowd. If left to them, he would face far more serious, even fatal, consequences. This is the picture of shame for #Turkey.https://twitter.com/muhalif_c/status/1119941824595005440 … Abdullah Ayasun added, I woke up into a terrible morning. Easter attack in Sri Lanka, mob attack against main opposition leader in Turkey. The former one was bloodier and a heavy blow to inter-faith peace. After New Zealand mosque attack, Sri Lanka took place in the pantheon of hate attacks. :( #Erdogan’s #Turkey. #Kılıçdaroğlu, mean opposition party leader in #Turkey attacked by mob during a Turkish soldier funereal. Yesterday 4 Turkish soldiers killed at the Iraqi border of the country.pic.twitter.com/2v1hvkrsaP Abdullah Ayasun Retweeted Kaç Saat Oldu? 🌍 The call for "burning that house" where CHP leader was kept after mob assault is a sad throwback in time, to the era where Turkey suffered bloody pogroms. One of the recent ones was in Sivas where a mob set a hotel ablaze, burning a group of Alevi intellectuals, artists alive. :(https://twitter.com/kacsaatolduson/status/1119939970297364481 … Abdullah Ayasun added, George Packer's in-depth and long-form piece about Richard Holbrooke appeared on @TheAtlantic May 2019 issue. https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/george-packer-pax-americana-richard-holbrooke/586042/ …  Then a similar piece was published this time on @ForeignAffairs May/June issue. https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-04-16/longest-wars … I did not get this. Abdullah Ayasun Retweeted HDP This inhumane treatment of women is disgusting and sickening. Their children are on hunger strike. And police displays its cruelty to mothers who sought to express their demands. I feel sick after watching this video. :(https://twitter.com/HDPgenelmerkezi/status/1119245416439209984 … Abdullah Ayasun added, This book review discusses the oscillation between democracy and dictatorship in Europe from Ancien Regime to today.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/books/review/sheri-berman-democracy-and-dictatorship-in-europe.html … Abdullah Ayasun Retweeted Bret Stephens Omar-bashing reveals some writers' deep intolerance of different voices and faces in the U.S. political scene. Although it is true that Ilhan Omar should pay more attention to the selection of wording in critical matters, media lynching is unacceptable and disgusting.https://twitter.com/BretStephensNYT/status/1118837294809735173 … Abdullah Ayasun added, Abdullah Ayasun Retweeted euronews Türkçe Watch this interview with a French lawmaker made by @RookieSkyBird. The lawmaker faced threats after involving in a debate with the Turkish foreign minister.https://twitter.com/euronews_tr/status/1118905067883646976 … Abdullah Ayasun added, Abdullah Ayasun Retweeted Selim Sazak "FETO" is a political invention. It is unfortunately adopted by discontents of the movement. Any respected scholar or someone aspiring to be a scholar should outright reject it. Writing in @ForeignPolicy should not obscure ideological obsession of Turkey observers like @scsazakhttps://twitter.com/scsazak/status/1118689484340637697 … Abdullah Ayasun added, Abdullah Ayasun Retweeted Sürgün Binbaşı A must-read thread about the collapse of Turkey's once mighty air force and its increasingly depleted well-trained and experienced personnel. The purge decimated air force staff, saw mass dismissal of best pilots. Inexperienced and amateurs filled the vacuum.https://twitter.com/SurgunBinbasi/status/1118213059653324800 … Abdullah Ayasun added, The biggest loser in the modern history of Turkish politics. Three positions, three titles were lost in less than a year. Now an ordinary lawmaker. His office has been relegated in Parliament, too. Losing Speaker's office, he has been given a small room in the basement floor. :) In less than a year, Binali Yildirim suffered a series of demotions. He first lost his post as a PM, as the position has been abolished with the new executive presidential system. He then lost his post as Parliament Speaker (so he could be Istanbul Mayor).Now he lost that, too :) Next step, he would go on to say, "Purge victims should not breathe. They are consuming oxygen too much. They must be banned." #MazbataGeldi Abdullah Ayasun Retweeted dokuz8HABER The trauma of losing Istanbul seems to have struck the government deeply. Deputy Chairman of the ruling AKP says purge victims should not be able to vote in elections. According to his logic, if you are a dismissed public worker, you do not have any right to vote. #MazbataGeldihttps://twitter.com/dokuz8haber/status/1118437042671837185 … Abdullah Ayasun added, Abdullah Ayasun Retweeted Beraat Gökkuş This is pro-government media when new Istanbul Mayor @ekrem_imamoglu delivers his speech after obtaining a mandate.https://twitter.com/RookieSkyBird/status/1118552301541756928 … Abdullah Ayasun added, I was in neighborhood to watch Andrei Tarkovsky’s Andrey Rublev movie. In some way it’s  a movie about building a church. After that #movie I started to walk to Odèon then saw the smoke.#NotreDame was burning. I was shocked. And now very very sad. #video #notredamedeparis #parispic.twitter.com/yEcsTgOudT

Thought from my dad: looking at 50s, 60s, 70s rock scene — bands came out of Britain (Beatles, Stones, Queen, Who, Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, etc) and soloist came out of US (Hendrix, Berry, Elvis, Ray Charles, Janis, Jackson, etc). 1) agree w/ premise?  2) If yes, why is that? For a week on vacation I didn’t read viral tweets, hot take, or  my mentions. I didn’t get into any back and forth or quote tweeted anything with a morally superior clever one liner. What do you know, the world still spins. I’m going to be slower on here. It’s a win win. Abraham Gutman 🔥 Retweeted Jake Tapper Heartbreaking.https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/1119937815503093762 … Abraham Gutman 🔥 added, To be clear: I don’t mean only commentary / pundatry.

So, what did I miss? Reply with a link to the best  takes that I missed from the past week. Going to spend all of tomorrow catching up. Go! Since 2011, I wasn’t sure where is home.

Founding editor at @PluralistMedia Are you sure you want to view these Tweets? Viewing Tweets won't unblock @AmsterdamLost Jonah Goldberg Retweeted Rolling Stone This is the most asinine thing I’ve read on the fire to date. And a competitor in the all around asinine category.https://twitter.com/rollingstone/status/1118243142686388232 … Jonah Goldberg added, Alex Griswold Retweeted Newsweek beginning to suspect the Jews do not in fact control the mediahttps://twitter.com/Newsweek/status/1115611575258374145 … Alex Griswold added, (((Yair Rosenberg))) Retweeted The Washington Post Stories like this are the consequence of news outlets taking their cues on anti-Semitism from partisans, rather than the organized Jewish community. The ADL, AJC, Union for Reform Judaism all called out Omar last month, but said absolutely *nothing* about this, because it's bunk.https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1115576878604214273 … (((Yair Rosenberg))) added, (((Yair Rosenberg))) Retweeted Jeremy Slevin This from Ilhan Omar's comms guy is deeply misguided.

I've reported on anti-Semitism for years across continents. It's not a Muslim problem, a Christian problem, a left problem or a right problem. It's a human problem.

Anyone telling you otherwise needs to educate themselves.https://twitter.com/jeremyslevin/status/1110651542930108416 … (((Yair Rosenberg))) added, David French Retweeted Dinesh D'Souza This is a ridiculously stupid tweet. Any sentient person knows that if a Muslim terrorist killed 49 Christians *in church* in New Zealand, it would be the biggest news in the world.https://twitter.com/DineshDSouza/status/1106527483246071808 … David French added, According to the children swarming Chelsea Clinton, a liberal American condemning Muslim anti-Semitism (or even “insensitivity”) by a progressive US politician invites white supremacist terrorism in ....New Zealand. This. Is. Insane.pic.twitter.com/oI0wraaLYS (((Yair Rosenberg))) Retweeted NowThis Omar said *nothing* about Israel and Israeli policy, and instead fulminated about the "allegiances" of AMERICANS.

What this video actually shows is that it's entirely possible to criticize Israel without being anti-Semitic, and normal good faith actors can tell the difference.https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1104857711156453376 … (((Yair Rosenberg))) added, Guy Benson Retweeted Yashar Ali  🐘 “My intention was to ask a question and start a debate” is almost identical to Omar’s defense of her own dual loyalty smear. It’s not a good one.https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1104941032955756544 … Guy Benson added, Mary Ellen Retweeted The Mary Sue a lot of misogynists hate this movie but that doesn’t mean criticizing it makes you a misogynist. and you don’t have to love it to be a feminist! everyone calm down. performative consumption is weird.https://twitter.com/TheMarySue/status/1102982518142320640 … Mary Ellen added, (((Yair Rosenberg))) Retweeted Dave Weigel It's almost like it's entirely possible to harshly criticize Israel *for years* in Congress and propose legislation to that effect without deploying anti-Semitic tropes every couple weeks. Betty McCollum, among others, has been doing it just fine.https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1102944906203533312 … (((Yair Rosenberg))) added, Since we are talking about making education affordable for all or even a human right, I have a simple idea that will radically decrease tuition costs for everyone and improve real education at the same time:pic.twitter.com/FYL2pY2Wfc It is with absolutely no glee in my heart and the greatest respect for the journalistic profession that I ask the Associated Press to kiss my ass, you hacks.pic.twitter.com/lZkdjdgiJd Lmao, my man didn’t even read the article.

Back for five shows only at my favorite west coast haunt.https://twitter.com/ILoveTheMarsh/status/1102721615362584576 … Adam Strauss added, NEW episode with @atomstrauss on mental health, OCD, therapy, psychedelics, relationships, + way more. it's a long vulnerable one.http://katiedalebout.com/podcast/adam-strauss/ … But to be clear psychedelics alone are not a silver bullet. Extensive, long-term post-trip support and integration are crucial. And cognitive-behavioral therapy is often indispensable as well. Especially because OCD is a progressive illness, it almost invariably gets worse over time. So arresting it early can lead to a much better lifetime prognosis. By the time I and most others try psychedelics, the disease is deeply entrenched. Drank ayahuasca this weekend for the first time in two years. I am more convinced than ever that for severe OCD, psychedelics should be the first treatment, not a last resort.

I’m so shook about what is happening in Sri Lanka, I’m not sure what to do. I’ve just been sitting here staring at Twitter like a helpless goof. 

I thought I would provide just a snapshot of the country for people unfamiliar: A 7th explosion has struck Colombo this #EasterSunday in a series of pre-planned and coordinated attacks. Death toll is expected to continue rising; unofficial sources currently reporting 200 killed. #Srilankahttps://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2019/apr/21/sri-lanka-explosions-dozens-killed-and-hundreds-injured-in-church-and-hotel-blasts?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Tweet … In plural societies like India's, majoritarian democracy can create an environment that encourages populism, excludes minorities and can lead to conflict and extremism. India is in danger of going down a slippery slope this election period...https://scroll.in/article/920668/pragya-singh-thakur-and-the-dangers-of-indias-emerging-majoritarian-democracy … Pakistan is amongst the top 25 countries sending students to US for education with an enrollment of over 7500 and growth trend of +4.5% which is 4% of 196,271 students of India studying in the US. #OpenDoorsReport #IEW2018pic.twitter.com/javk7t3oYt People wonder why veterans like to stick with other veterans so much. But have you ever tried to explain even the basics about your service to someone with absolutely no concept of the military? I want to put my head through a wall. I’ve explained the difference between enlisted and officer; that the Marine Corps and Army are not the same; yes, women deploy; and now we’re on the acronyms involved in my enlistment (DLI, DLPT, SCIF, etc) 1. This video presents good points about #Pakistan's tourism including unclear travel restrictions (e.g., NOCs) & overly positive campaigns. But saying something is not in one’s financial interest is also one of the oldest marketing techniques in the book.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iudspL1wM_Q … In @washingtonpost's @monkeycageblog, @emily_tallo & I explore why heated debate over whether India shot down a Pakistani F-16 matters. The answer poses implications for IND elections, IND military effectiveness, & US expectations of IND balancing in Asia.https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/17/did-india-shoot-down-pakistani-f-back-february-this-just-became-big-deal/?utm_term=.90a83ef7c1d6 … 8. Most importantly, the focus of tourism should be to create a good experience and invigorate local small businesses. Deconstructing and shaping narratives comes later and can only happen organically. 7. There is indeed an echo chamber within the #Pakistan tourism world at present. The marketing campaign outside of the country appears nonexistent. Local influencers should be promoted & foreign documentary makers should be permitted to discuss more than just food. 6. When Anthony Bourdain visited Russia, he spoke w/ dissidents at a protest. In another episode he went to Georgia’s equivalent to the LoC & had dinner with a government official. Both episodes made you want to visit the destination but can you imagine it happening in #Pakistan? 5. By stifling well-meaning constructive criticism of the country, #Pakistan's gov. risks inviting even harsher critiques and this viral video is one of many examples. 4. The video is correct that independent travel in #Pakistan is a pain due to unclear rules. Other countries let you go to any city with a valid visa & open yet restricted cantonments don't exist. @pid_gov should be transparent about restricted areas so tourists can comply. 3. Any individual foreigner or gov. that takes an interest in #Pakistan regardless of background does so because we see a personal opportunity. Many privileged Pakistanis jumpstart their careers in the US/UK as well. The altruistic foreigner arriving just to help does not exist. 2. When a foreign influencer/blogger/writer/journalist advocates for more local voices remember that they invariably mean *in addition* to rather than *instead* of their own. If #Pakistan wants to market its tourism effectively then it will have to invest in both. 1. This video presents good points about #Pakistan's tourism including unclear travel restrictions (e.g., NOCs) & overly positive campaigns. But saying something is not in one’s financial interest is also one of the oldest marketing techniques in the book.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iudspL1wM_Q … Laura Rozen Retweeted Justin Miller ICE deported the spouse of a US soldier killed in Afghanistan, leaving the couple’s 12yo daughter, a US citizen, in Phoenix without parentshttps://twitter.com/justinjm1/status/1117947818763747328 … Laura Rozen added, When do militaries refuse to repress protesters? In a new article for @ISQ_Jrnl, I asked this question to Tunisian military officers themselves in a survey. Their corporate interests and composition were the most important predictors of defection.https://academic.oup.com/isq/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/isq/sqz003/5438330?redirectedFrom=fulltext … They talk about how Muslims would be booted out in the ‘New India’, and how foreigners were unacceptable and unwelcome in India. 

Let me clarify: they aren’t talking to this family directly. The conversation is between the 4 of them.... (4) Watching Trump’s targeting of 
@IlhanMN, I think of an entire industry of outlets & pundits across the spectrum that use shame campaigns based on out-of-context statements to get ratings. Some of these voices view themselves as a vanguard of truth but Trump learned their tactics.

    by Adele M. Stan   On a blistering day in Merrimack, N.H., the townspeople assemble for their annual Fourth of July parade. Little girls, on bicycles decorated with crepe-paper streamers and American flags, buzz with excitement. The fire engine is in place, as are the Dixieland band, the Cub Scout troop, a yellow school bus, and a big, white-columned float full of cross-legged children. New Hampshire Gov. Steve Merrill is at the head of the line. The only ingredients missing are the guests of honor: GOP presidential contenders Bob Dole, Phil Gramm, and Pat Buchanan.
  Gramm arrives first, fresh from his self-proclaimed victory derailing President Clinton’s nomination of Henry Foster for surgeon general. Marching with Gramm are Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.), one of the national co-chairs of his campaign, and Gramm’s wife, Wendy, who, as an Asian-American, stands out in Merrimack’s parade.
  Just as the line begins to move, Dole and his wife, Elizabeth, backed by a herd of supporters traveling in a magnificent old red trolley car, arrive to take their place ahead of the Gramms. Then Buchanan lines up behind the Dole and Gramm contingents. In contrast to the polite reception given the other candidates, the response offered by Buchanan’s supporters is spirited. “How ya doin’, Pat?” well-wishers shout. “Go, Pat, go!” cry others, echoing his campaign slogan. Buchanan bounds from one side of the street to the other, sweat pouring off him. His right eye keeps snapping shut, perhaps from exhaustion, but that never stops him; he just wears a perpetual wink to match his smile.
  Every four years, the campaign circus swings through New Hampshire in homage to the state’s kick-off position in the presidential primary season. As a backdrop for political posturing, Merrimack is the perfect Anytown, U.S.A. And its location in the southernmost part of New Hampshire, smack between Manchester, home of the rightward-listing Union Leader, and Nashua, one of New England’s high-tech enclaves, places it on the edge of the Boston media market.
  If the leading contenders for the GOP nomination are counting on the particulars of Merrimack’s political and geographic landscape to win them a national audience, so, too, is the religious right, which has ensnared the town’s local politics in a web of hot button issues as it seeks to shape the outcome of the 1996 presidential election. Leading the crusade is Ralph Reed’s right-wing Christian Coalition, from whose ranks Gov. Merrill has made appointments to several key state government positions. In May, Merrill hosted Reed’s visit to New Hampshire, where Reed addressed the state Senate and organized his local Coalition supporters.
  So, prominent among Dole’s delegation in the small-town parade is Merrimack School Board Chairman Chris Ager, a Christian conservative. And Buchanan’s delegation stars Shelly Uscinski, the county co-chair of his campaign and also a member of the Merrimack school board. Uscinski, who in the past 18 months has catapulted into the national limelight as an activist for the Christian Coalition, won a seat on the school board by a close vote in 1994.
  Uscinski and her running mate, who were encouraged to run by Ager, joined him on the board to form a right-wing Christian majority. Since then, school business has taken a backseat to debates over creationism, school prayer, sex education, and–most recently–homosexuality, tearing the town into warring factions.
  Soon after taking power, the Christian majority rammed through a policy to start Merrimack’s school day with a moment of silence. But all hell broke loose when the school board entertained a proposal to add creationism to Merrimack’s science curriculum. No longer a mere stage set for the presidential road company, the town itself became the story–CBS News spent more than six months filming a documentary on its politics, which many locals complain are being manipulated for the benefit of conservative outsiders with their own agenda.
  “This used to be a nice, progressive town,” then-school board member Chuck Mower complained to a reporter after one raucous board meeting on creationism. “Now we’re just a gooberville in Arkansas.”
  After the parade, Dole poses for photos with locals. A circle of reporters crowds around the GOP’s front-runner, holding Dole captive in the high school’s shadeless parking lot. When Mother Jones asks Dole about the influence of the Christian Coalition on the Republican race, he reveals his discomfort with the new flavor of his party’s politics.
  “They’re well organized and they do a good job,” he says. “But they’re like all other voters–they believe in the country; they think that voting’s a very precious right we have in America.”
  Asked to comment on the Christian right’s efforts to teach creationism in Merrimack’s public schools, the Senate majority leader declines, then breaks in nervously, “I think their normal activity is–they’re worried about jobs, they’re worried about a balanced budget, they’re worried about a tax cut for families with children….”
  “The economic issues?” the reporter offers.
  “Yes, that’s right,” Dole replies.
  Dole just doesn’t seem to want to get it. He wants to win badly, but his heart’s not in the fight to make America a Christian nation.
  Just as Dole and his followers make a break for the relative cool of the high school’s corridors, Phil Gramm heads for the van that will carry him out of Merrimack. Asked about the Christian Coalition, he says, “I’m proud of the fact that people all over the country who hold to traditional values, to family and faith, are coming to the Republican Party. I’m proud of the fact that the people who do the work, pay the taxes, pull the wagon, are coming our way.”
  And Merrimack’s creationism flap? “I want local parents and local teachers to run education,” he asserts, “not the federal government.” Now that’s what social conservatives want to hear–and Gramm got the message the hard way after the religious right’s heavy hitters pummeled him last May for not sounding their themes loudly enough. Since then, Gramm has been speaking in Christian code, even making references to the Second Coming.
  Buchanan, meanwhile, has already moved on to a pig roast sponsored by the Conservative Party Victory Fund in nearby Dunbarton, where his competitors will rejoin him later. Political pundits are already preaching that the 1996 election may sound the death knell for the two-party system, and Buchanan’s name has long been bandied about as a contender who could run strongly on a third-party ticket. The pig roast offers him the opportunity to rub shoulders with George Fellendorf, chairman of the New Hampshire Christian Coalition, and also with the state’s most powerful Coalition supporter, Gov. Merrill.
  In August of 1992, Patrick J. Buchanan, the blusterous pundit and failed presidential candidate, stunned the nation with perhaps the most bilious political speech since the days of George Wallace. “There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America,” Buchanan bellowed from the pulpit bestowed on him as a consolation prize at the GOP National Convention in Houston. “It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the Cold War itself.” He urged conventioneers to “take back our cities, take back our culture, take back our country” from the feminists, environmentalists, and gays who, along with the rioters in the streets of Los Angeles, had stolen America from its rightful heirs.
  Buchanan’s diatribe brought lots of bad press to the party of Lincoln. After the election, when analysts discussed why Clinton won, they routinely mentioned the Houston debacle. But reports of the demise of Buchanan and his supporters proved to be extremely premature. Three years later, with the successful insurgency of the Christian Coalition in close to two-thirds of the GOP’s state organizations, the religious right sees the brass ring of the presidency within its grasp. It has become a controlling influence on the direction of the primaries, forcing top contenders like Dole and Gramm to run a gauntlet that has propelled them even further to the right on key issues.
  Although he has no official connection to the Christian Coalition, Buchanan has become an implicit threat to–and a rightward influence on–the Republican Party. He draws key staffers and a significant following from the Coalition’s ranks, and he conceivably could take his faithful with him if the Republican Party fails to toe his ideological line.
  Though Buchanan bills himself as a proud Roman Catholic, his fealty is to a church that now exists only in his mind. His is the church of the 1950s, before Vatican II blew through, leaving a swath of cultural icons in its wake–the nun’s habit, the Latin Mass, Friday-night fish. Buchanan’s church occupies a time when men were men, women covered their heads when they entered the house of God, and the blood of Christ remained on the hands of the Jews. He wouldn’t recognize the church of Thomas Merton, the Berrigan brothers, or, God forbid, Dorothy Day, if he sat on its steeple. But despite his staunch anti- abortion rhetoric and talk of moral decency, Buchanan doesn’t come across as a particularly pious man but, rather, as one whose cultural identity derives from the iron-fisted, anti-communist church of his childhood.
  Early in June, Mother Jones caught up with Buchanan at yet another pig roast, an event billed as Family Day on the Merrimack grounds of a gun owner’s club that bears a benign name, the Nashua Fish and Game Society. Amid kids decked in camouflage and NRA caps and their swaggering parents, we asked the candidate to comment on the charge that the religious right was dividing the Republican Party. “Oh, I think–look, we had a great leader named Ronald Reagan, who united the Republican Party–all of those folks [who elected Reagan] were religious…. And I welcome them in my camp, and in the party.”
  Did he have anything to say about the creationism controversy in Merrimack? “Not at this picnic, I don’t,” he said. But before boarding the van to his next stop, Buchanan turned around and added he’d be happy to comment on the Merrimack situation another time. When contacted later, Buchanan spokesperson K.B. Forbes explained that his boss is in favor of “local control” of the public schools. For more than a year now, “local control” in Merrimack has meant the Christian Coalition’s Shelly Uscinski and her allies.
  The Christian right is a confounding phenomenon; every time it does itself in, it rises from its own ashes in an even more virulent strain. Neither the death of Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority, the scandals of television preachers Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker, nor the failure of Pat Robertson’s absurd 1988 presidential candidacy have managed to finish it off.
  The history of evangelical Christianity in America predates even the founding of the republic, and its influence on our society cannot be exorcised without unraveling the very fabric of our culture. Born of the Great Awakening in the 1730s, Christian evangelism is a product of the American soil, an outgrowth of Massachusetts Puritanism, conceived in answer to the terrors of wilderness life in territories inhabited only by the “heathen” Indians.
  After the Constitution and the secular state it created became the law of the land, America’s revivalist religion preached a doctrine advocating “separation from the world,” which all but forbade involvement in such a worldly pursuit as politics. But 200 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, Jimmy Carter heralded a new age when he ran for president. His description of himself as “born again” in the ’76 campaign won him the votes of Southern evangelicals. And there the right saw its opening.
  “I think the die was cast 15 years ago,” says women’s rights activist Faye Wattleton, former president of Planned Parenthood. “People were not paying any attention to the right-wing Republican effort to seize upon televangelism’s viewers, to really mobilize them.”
  Indeed, it was the secular players of the New Right–Paul Weyrich, Richard Viguerie, and Howard Phillips–who turned the religious right into a political force in the ’70s and ’80s. The three had met in the mid-1960s as young men working inside the Beltway–Weyrich on the Hill in the offices of Colorado Sen. Gordon Allott, Viguerie in the Washington office of William F. Buckley’s Young Americans for Freedom, and Phillips in the headquarters of the Republican National Committee.
  Over the next three decades, Weyrich earned credit for being the New Right’s principal architect–the issues man, the strategy guy. Viguerie became the resident expert at a new technique, direct-mail fundraising (which he borrowed from the left), creating the lists that formed the backbone of the New Right’s support. And Phillips aimed his energies at grassroots organizing.
  It was Weyrich who, foreseeing the denouement of the communist Evil Empire, first embraced social issues as a cause to rally the troops. A conservative, Eastern-rite Catholic, he was already sensitive to the issue of abortion, which relatively few Protestants fretted over back in the ’70s.
  Viguerie, meanwhile, had taken as his first big client Alabama’s segregationist governor and perennial third-party presidential candidate, George Wallace. Viguerie’s mass-produced missives (sent to a mailing list left over from Barry Goldwater’s failed campaign) yielded Wallace some $6.9 million, a substantial sum in 1976 for a long-shot candidate. But the real winner was Viguerie, who walked away at the campaign’s end with Wallace’s list of angry whites from which to launch his own efforts.
  After a stint in the Nixon administration, Phillips began to build his base in 1974, founding the Conservative Caucus. Viguerie did the direct-mail work, while Phillips visited all 435 of the nation’s voting districts in search of grassroots support.
  Then, in 1979, at the urging of Ed McAteer of the Religious Roundtable, Weyrich and Phillips engineered the Moral Majority, drafting Jerry Falwell to front the first organization that built a mass following for conservative religious politics.
  Weyrich, meanwhile, managed to tap the Coors beer fortune to fund his newly founded Heritage Foundation, now one of Washington’s most influential think tanks. He and Viguerie also masterminded the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress, which evolved into Weyrich’s present-day Free Congress Foundation (FCF), his base of operations. FCF does everything from training future leaders in Eastern Europe to running National Empowerment Television, the right-wing, tax-exempt network that broadcasts Newt Gingrich’s made-for-TV college course, “Renewing American Civilization,” as well as several Christian right shows. In 1992, the last year for which figures are available, the FCF, chaired by Jeffrey H. Coors, reported revenues of $5.19 million.
  Weyrich also inspired the formation of the Christian Coalition in 1989, and many of the themes sounded in the Coalition’s “Contract With the American Family” can be found in one form or another in the secular publications of the Heritage and Free Congress foundations–from school vouchers to the elimination of the Department of Education and of the National Endowment for the Arts. Other conservative causes, such as withholding welfare benefits from unmarried women, also emanate from the brains of Weyrich and his associates.
  With his phalanx of think tanks and PACs, Weyrich has maintained an image of public respectability, despite the extremism of some of his views. For instance, in a 1990 speech to Washington’s University Club, Weyrich advised Congress to declare an official war on drugs, so that drug users and dealers, once apprehended, could be denied their right of habeas corpus and held as prisoners of war, allowing for their indeterminate incarceration under the provisions of the Geneva Convention. He also advocated the recruitment of high school-aged students for the formation of a domestic “peace squad” under the direction of the military and empowered to conduct surveillance on civilians.
  If you think that’s scary, consider the clues to Weyrich’s personal theology, which appears to be sympathetic to a form of medieval Catholicism exemplified by his support of the arch right-wing Catholic society, Tradition, Family, and Property (TFP). Founded in 1960 in opposition to Brazil’s land-reform efforts, TFP recruits adolescent boys and trains them in the use of the combat regalia of the Middle Ages–maces, crossbows, and the like. The organization’s Brazilian founder, Plinio Corea de Oliveira, once called the Spanish Inquisition “the most beautiful page in the history of the Church.” In 1986, wrote the late Catholic journalist Penny Lernoux, the American branch of the TFP feted Weyrich at its estate in Bedford, N.Y., “as a friend who has defended the TFP movement…and offered sound advice on the battle terrain.” Weyrich failed to respond to Mother Jones‘ request for comment.
  Today Weyrich remains the right’s kingpin, the point of convergence between the secular and the religious right. An active strategist for the Christian Coalition, he appears with convicted felon Oliver North in a recruitment video, “America at a Crossroads,” and speaks to its assemblies, most recently at last September’s “Road to Victory” conference. The Christian Coalition embodies the refinement of classic Weyrich techniques, especially the pairing of high technology with a bogus populism directed from the top down. With its professionally produced downlink television show, its site on the World Wide Web, relentless direct-mail efforts, and grassroots organizing, the Christian Coalition epitomizes the thoroughly bankrolled reach of the New Right.
  Because of the proximity of its Virginia headquarters to Washington, D.C., and the East Coast media markets, the Christian Coalition comprises the most visible component of the religious right. Forming the root of the Coalition’s power is the unlikely wedding of conservative Catholics with Protestant evangelicals, a Weyrich idea.
  But deep in the cultural consciousness of American Catholics is the memory of prejudice and exclusion by the Protestant majority, while the doctrines of evangelicals characterize Catholicism, at best, as a heresy and, at worst, as the great whore of Babylon, the leading lady of the Book of Revelation. Just how long these two groups, with their history of mutual resentment, can hold together is a matter best left to the oracle.
  Nonetheless, the Christian Coalition, which was created from the mailing lists of the Rev. Pat Robertson’s failed 1988 presidential bid, has essentially created its own party within the GOP by encouraging its members to run for the grunt jobs in the local, county, and state Republican committees. According to a 1994 survey conducted by Campaigns & Elections magazine, the Christian right dominates the GOP organizations of some 18 states, and holds considerable sway in another 13. No Republican presidential candidate can win the nomination without the support of the Coalition and its allies, or so goes the conventional wisdom. True or not, none of the GOP contenders seems willing to test the theory.
  As revealed in the 1994 congressional elections, in which only 39 percent of registered voters managed to get to the polls, the Christian Coalition has learned to make the most of America’s dwindling voter turnout by mobilizing the nation’s fearful fringe with the promise of turning back the tide of modernity. When the Republicans won the Congress, Ralph Reed was quick to take the credit.
  But the Christian Coalition is hardly what it claims to be–a grassroots organization with a massive membership. Early in 1995, the Coalition spent more than $1 million, by its own account, toward the passage of House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s “Contract With America.” Its investment apparently ensured Republican support for the Coalition’s own “Contract With the American Family,” which Reed later unveiled with Gingrich at his side.
  (The Coalition waited out the new Congress’ first 100 days and then moved in to exact its pound of flesh. “We certainly did not want to do to the new Republican Congress what the gays and feminists did to [Bill Clinton]” in his first 100 days of office, Reed told CBS News, explaining the Coalition’s delay in pushing its legislative agenda.)
  Many of the Coalition’s famously skewed voter guides for local, state, and national races are printed in Robertson’s Virginia headquarters and distributed in churches the weekend before an election. And, though the Christian Coalition claims to be a 501(c)(4) tax-exempt organization, Mother Jones found that the IRS has yet to accord it that status. Likewise, the organization’s claim of some 1.7 million supporters seems dubious, at best. In its 1995 official statement of circulation for its membership publication, Christian American, the Coalition counted the paper’s subscribers at 450,000.
  “Sometimes the perception of power is equal to the reality of it,” Robertson told a National Journal reporter in 1979, “and if people perceive it’s there, maybe we can have some influence.”
  In the halls of Congress and on the campaign trail, the Christian Coalition certainly suffers no lack of influence, whatever its real numbers. In Washington, money talks, and the Coalition’s $25 million annual budget is only a fraction of Pat Robertson’s $140 million-a-year empire. Key provisions of the Coalition’s “contract” are on their way to becoming law, including the defunding of federal welfare programs, education, arts, and humanities–while providing “family-friendly tax relief.”
  Most ominously, the contract would recriminalize certain abortion procedures, part of what some have dubbed the right’s “erosion strategy” on a woman’s right to choose. The fate of the contract’s first pledge, the Religious Equality Amendment to the Constitution, is less certain; the amendment would expand the legal allowance for prayer and other religious expression in public settings.
  More than just a blueprint for congressional action, the “Contract With the American Family” serves as a manifesto for the major Republican presidential candidates, all of whom have embraced some of its more significant provisions.
  Last August, on the eve of his embarrassment in the straw poll sponsored by the Iowa Republican Party, Senate Majority Leader Dole met with Reed and others from the religious right and lurched further rightward, promising to do his best to incorporate their concerns into the welfare reform legislation being hammered out in Congress.
  And in his noncampaign sweep through New Hampshire in early June, Gingrich paid his own tribute at a gathering of conservative Christians in Manchester, where he held an installment of his televised college course, “Renewing American Civilization.”
  “If you had said to the Founding Fathers, all of you who want to belong to the Christian Coalition have to leave, I don’t think you could have gotten a quorum in Philadelphia,” Professor Gingrich said. He neglected to note that when, at the Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin proposed the delegates pray together, his motion was tabled.
  If you’re planning a revolution, it’s always a good idea to have God on your side, and when the right got religion, it found the perfect means to stave off criticism. No one wants to be accused of Christian-bashing, a charge that stands at the ready whenever the right’s agenda is held up to the light.
  “There seems to be a nerve that’s touched in the hearts of more progressive people,” says Wattleton, “that maybe these people have a right to work for something they believe in. My view is–not quite. There are limits to what we ought to be willing to tolerate in the name of what people believe in.”
  Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, Ph.D., of the Interfaith Alliance, a coalition of clergy formed to oppose the religious right, sees something sinister in the language of the right: the exploitation of a religious impulse felt by the economically strapped middle class to further an agenda that will only fill the coffers of the rich. “They are putting on the magic act of family values,” says Hertzberg, “while the pickpocket in league with them goes through the crowd and steals their wallets.”
  As a movement made up of people drawn from a range of denominations, the religious right has co-opted the name of Christianity in the service of an overarching doctrine of power known as dominion theology.
  “The Constitution of the United States,” Robertson told the audience of his television show, “The 700 Club,” “is a marvelous document for self- government by Christian people. But the minute you turn the document into the hands of non-Christians and atheistic people, they can use it to destroy the very foundation of our society.” Robertson’s assertion alludes to his dominionist belief that Christians, while awaiting Jesus’ Second Coming, have the duty to “rule and reign” in His absence in order to prepare the world for His return.
  Robertson’s brand of dominion theology derives from an even more extreme doctrine that evolved in the 1970s, Christian reconstructionism. Despite its obvious contrivances, Christian reconstructionism, the brainchild of crackpot theologian Rousas John Rushdoony, has had a serious impact on the religious right. Hardcore Christian reconstructionists, such as Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, call for no less than the reconstitution of the law of ancient Israel as the law of the land.
  The emphasis here is not simply on the Ten Commandments, but rather the whole of the severe law of the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible), which calls for death by stoning for adulterers, practicing homosexuals, and insubordinate children. The more humane Jewish law of later years is ignored. And it’s hard to find Jesus’ teachings in reconstructionist and dominionist thought, which seems to ignore the Savior’s lessons about turning the other cheek, rendering unto Caesar, and judging not your neighbor. What, one wonders, do they make of the incident in which Jesus defused a mob keen to stone an adulteress?
   Even Howard Phillips, though born Jewish, seems to embrace some form of Christian reconstructionism. “I believe that God does judge a society, and that a society that shows so little regard for God’s creation in terms of human life and in other ways, is one from which He withdraws His hand of protection,” Phillips told Mother Jones.
  “It either is, as the Framers said [that] we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights and God is the source of authority…”–or, as Phillips sees it, the godless doctrines of libertarianism or liberalism supplant the Founders’ vision by ceding authority to either the individual or the state.
  There’s a classic bit of subterfuge in Phillips’ invocation of the Constitution’s Framers; that document contains no reference to God. The reference to a vaguely defined Creator as the source of human rights comes from the Declaration of Independence, whose principal author, Thomas Jefferson, rejected the divinity of Jesus, whom he believed to be the architect of a sublime system of ethics. Jefferson went so far as to craft his own version of the Bible, omitting the miracles ascribed to the Christian messiah.
  Whatever its theological underpinnings, the Christian America envisioned by the New Right is enough to chill the soul. In a Christian America, there would likely be no jails, since the Bible calls for only two punishments for serious criminals: the making of restitution or execution. Women would be mandated to bear any seed implanted in the womb, by whatever means. (Activists like Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum object to exemptions in proscriptions against abortion even for the victims of rape and incest.) And, although Jesus urged His people to suffer the little children, in the right’s Christian America, adults would be free to inflict whatever suffering they deign on minors: The intrusive state would be stripped of its power to identify and protect at-risk kids.
  Books deemed obscene by the Christian state would be banned, public squares would be dominated by the symbols of the ruling faith, and the borders of a Christian America would be closed to newcomers, regardless of the oppression they experience in their homelands. In short, the inhabitants of the right’s Christian nation would find mercy in short supply.
  To the outsider, the Christian right appears as a monolith, united against what it perceives to be the twin plagues of permissiveness and pluralism.
  But take a closer look and things are not nearly so simple; you’ll find instead a teeming mass of competing interests and delicate egos, shifting alliances and ideological spats. In recent months, evidence of a growing rift within the right has become increasingly apparent.
  Leading the pragmatic faction are Weyrich and Viguerie, who support the Christian Coalition’s determination to back a Republican nominee who looks like a winner. Meanwhile, Howard Phillips, who still counts Viguerie and Weyrich among his close friends, hopes to ride the rage of the purists who are disgusted with Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour’s refusal to abandon the party’s purported “big tent” (i.e., all positions welcome) approach to the abortion issue.
  Phillips and other dissidents see the Coalition’s willingness to back a candidate with a pro-choice past as a sellout. They don’t like Dole or Gramm, regardless of what these candidates are saying now. Phillips and his fellow conservatives feel burned by their support of George Bush in ’88 and ’92, and even Reagan in the ’80s–because when the 12 consecutive years of Republican White House occupancy were over, abortion remained legal, the Department of Education was still in business, and lesbians and gays had continued to gain acceptance.
 
	“There are some people who would stick with the Republican
Party if they
nominated Judas,” says Phillips. “And they would still call him
Christian, and
they would still call themselves Christian. I don’t know what the
opposite of a
yellow-dog Democrat is, but there are a lot of those in the Christian
right and
in the Republican Party.”
 
	For his part, the tough-talking Phillips seems determined to
bust up the
two-party system on his own, if he has to. In 1992, Phillips founded
the U.S.
Taxpayers Party and ran for president, managing to get on the ballot
in 21
states–no small feat. He became notorious in Iowa when he ran
campaign ads
filled with footage of bloody discarded fetuses. The ads were so gory
that
local TV stations refused to air them except late at night, but they
still got
shown in TV discussions of his tactics, thereby affording Phillips his
15
minutes of fame.
 
	Some of Phillips’ party soldiers also engage in dangerous
rhetoric. According
to a report by investigative journalist John Goetz in a Planned
Parenthood
publication, Rev. Matthew Trewhella, Wisconsin chairman of the
Taxpayers Party,
told followers at a 1994 convention: “This Christmas I want you to do
the most
loving thing…buy each of your children an SKS rifle and 500 rounds
of
ammunition….” Jeffrey Baker, a member of the party’s national
committee,
reportedly received a hearty round of applause when he told the
crowd that
“abortionists should be put to death.”
 
	(When asked by Mother Jones about his party’s links to
the militia
movement, Phillips replied, “It’s absolute nonsense. We are not
involved in the
killing business; Planned Parenthood is Murder Incorporated.”)
 
	At the moment, Phillips is consumed, he says, with the work of
trying to
secure ballot lines for the Taxpayers Party in every state before the
party’s
national convention begins on Aug. 15 in San Diego–the day before
the GOP
convention closes there. He’s hoping to pick up Pat Buchanan as his
candidate
in the likely event that the Republicans don’t nominate him. But,
failing that,
he’d probably settle for Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Calif.) or another anti-
choice
zealot.
 
	Phillips thinks Buchanan’s chances of winning the GOP
nomination are slim. “I
love Pat and I wish him well,” Phillips explains, “but…I think the
present
reality, more than ever, militates in favor of an independent
candidacy. Does
he see that? No, he doesn’t see that today. Will he see it later? Well,
if I’ve
got 50 ballot lines, and if there are significant voices–people who
aren’t
there now–saying this is something we ought to be doing, it could be
a
different story.”
 
	In February, Phillips announced a strategy whereby Buchanan
could launch a
third-party bid with nearly unlimited funding, if he’d only reject
federal
matching funds and choose either a billionaire running mate from
the ranks of
the right’s sugar daddies (a Buchanan/Coors ticket?), or, in a far-
fetched
scheme, name a different running mate on each state ballot, as long
as the
running mates were all wealthy. (Federal statutes allow candidates to
spend
unlimited amounts of their personal wealth for campaigns, but these
individuals
then can’t accept federal matching funds.)
 
	Buchanan spokesperson K.B. Forbes says the “Buchanan for
President” campaign
does intend to apply for federal matching funds. But Buchanan may
be hedging
his bets.
 
	He has formed a national advisory committee of wealthy
contributors to New Right causes, including W. Grover Coors, Thomas
Monaghan of
Domino’s Pizza, and Roger Milliken, the textiles magnate and longtime
member of
the John Birch Society.
 
	The Buchanan campaign’s national co-chairs are the Rev.
Donald Wildmon of the
American Family Association, who spearheaded protests against the
National
Endowment for the Arts as well as Martin Scorsese’s film, The Last
Temptation of Christ, and Michael Farris, the former general
counsel for
Beverly LaHaye’s Concerned Women for America who evinces
nostalgia for Puritan
theocracy.
 
	Pat Buchanan and Howard Phillips aren’t the only heavy hitters
on the
Christian right who could split with the Republican Party. Another is
James
Dobson, the only leader on the religious right who rivals the Christian
Coalition’s Robertson. Dobson’s Focus on the Family empire was built
on the
success of his 1970 child-rearing book, Dare to Discipline.
Dobson’s
multimedia enterprise, based in Colorado Springs, includes a
syndicated radio
show claiming 5 million weekly listeners, magazines, a burgeoning
video
business, a staff of some 1,300, and an annual budget of $100
million.
 
	In March, Dobson fired a warning shot at the GOP. In an eight-
page letter to 2
million supporters, Dobson stated his intention to abandon the
Republican Party
for a third-party candidate if the GOP removes the anti-abortion
plank from its
platform, or nominates a candidate who is not sufficiently “pro-life.”  
	“There can be no compromise on an issue with such profound
moral
implications,” Dobson wrote. “It is an affront to God Himself.”
 
	Dobson’s growing power was much in evidence at the May
meeting of the Council
for National Policy (CNP), a thrice-yearly ecumenical gathering of the
right’s
movers and shakers in McLean, Va. A clandestine organization of
some 500
members, the CNP has provided right-wing activists and funders a
regular
networking forum for the past 14 years. The lack of public scrutiny
allows CNP
members to get down to business and duke out strategy, says Skipp
Porteous,
vice president of the Institute for First Amendment Studies, a
watchdog group
that tracks the Christian right.
 
	At the May meeting, according to documents and banquet hall
seating lists
obtained by Porteous, Dobson was honored with a seat at one of the
most
important tables while the leadership of the Christian Coalition was
noticeably
absent. With Dobson’s threat to the GOP ringing like music in his ears,
Howard
Phillips buttonholed Dobson, pitching his Taxpayers Party as the
natural home
for an ideologically correct contender. Dobson asked Phillips to put
something
in writing. In a June 2 confidential memo, which was obtained by
Porteous,
Phillips states all the things a pro-life president could do “to end
legal
abortion in America,” such as declaring Roe vs. Wade unconstitutional
as a
violation of states’ rights.
 
	“Like Asa in the Bible, he can teach the nation about the laws of
God and the
obligations of man,” Phillips wrote. His choice of Asa, a minor biblical  king,
is telling. Asa’s claim to fame was his promise to put to death all who
worshipped gods other than Yahweh, “whether of high or low degree,
man or
woman.”
 
	Phillips went on to urge Dobson to help him secure the ballot
lines he needs.
“More than anyone else in America today,” he added, “you have the
power to make
that happen.” Dobson’s response to the memo is unknown, but
Phillips contends
that “significant people–people whose names are household words”
support his
plan.
 
	Whatever the outcome in 1996, Howard Phillips sees the
election in the year
2000–the millennium–as the day of reckoning. He predicts a
“hyperinflationary
depression” due to the strains of the national debt on the economy,
which will
“terminally undermine confidence in whoever controls the
presidency when it
hits.”
 
	What the Christian right realizes and is poised to take
advantage of, Phillips
implies, is that social movements are built on economic distress. “The
death of
the Weimar Republic, the opportunity for the National Socialists to
come up in
the ’20s, was the result of the fact that the people were hurt
economically,”
Phillips told Mother Jones. “…In the United States, we got under  way
because of economic concerns…. The French Revolution was, to some
degree,
fueled by economic concerns. So, I think what will trigger [a right-
wing
Christian revolution] is the economic problems.”
 
	The real issue is not so much whether the religious right wins
this particular
national election or the next, nor whether it launches a third-party
candidacy,
controls the GOP nomination process, or both. The real problem for an
economically troubled America is the tremendous political power the
religious
right already wields. As Faye Wattleton notes, “What frightens me
most [about
the Christian right] is that most people are not frightened by it.”
 
	On a balmy August night, the Merrimack High School
auditorium is packed with
some 400 people, the biggest turnout for a school board meeting
since the board
debated creationism earlier in the year.
 
	Tonight’s hot button issue is homosexuality; Ken Coleman and
Brenda Grady, the
board’s progressive minority, are battle-ready to take on the
Christian
majority’s new anti-gay measure, crafted, they believe, to broadcast
one of the
Christian right’s favorite themes in the advent months of the
presidential
primary. The proposed measure, modeled after a national
amendment pushed by
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.), would prevent
the
schools–including counselors–from offering any instruction or
advice that
would have “the purpose or effect” of affirming homosexuality as an
acceptable
way of life.
 
	Outside in the parking lot, while the anti-gay measure is being
debated, a
somber crowd assembles around a pickup truck set up like a stage.
Former school
board member Chuck Mower stands in the pickup, surveying the
dozens of candles
held by the crowd. Mower, a stocky, bearded man of 46, allowed
another
progressive candidate to replace him on the school board earlier this
year
after he became exhausted by the creationism battle.
 
	Ever since the Christian right chose Merrimack for its test
market, the lives
of those committed to an ethic of civic responsibility have been
forever
changed. The effort to turn back the right demands a near full-time
commitment,
depleting incomes and straining family ties.
 
	Tonight Mower is about to declare his candidacy for next
spring’s school board
elections, something he’s still not sure he wants to do. Really, he tells  the
reporter, he’d rather get back to his business of making Windsor
chairs, which
he crafts in the barn of the house where he grew up, a 200-year-old
homestead
where he now raises his own family.
 
	But the times won’t wait, so, after telling a story about how his
experience
as a member of the multi-ethnic troops that braved the jungles of
Vietnam
steeled him against the forces of intolerance, he throws his hat into
the
three-ring circus of Merrimack’s national politics.

You were selected as a possible participant in this study because of your indication that you are seeking treatment for alcohol or drug dependence or another addictive disorder.  Your participation in this research study is voluntary. After reading below, please choose whether to continue on to the study's screening portion or to exit from the study by pressing the appropriate button.
					 Why is this study being done?
					 We are conducting this study in order to test whether people's ideas regarding recovery
from addiction changes as they move from treatment seeking to exploring treatment
options, contacting, and enrolling in treatment. We are also testing the usefulness of using
an automated system to help people who are looking for treatment find appropriate
providers.
					 What will happen if I take part in this research study?
					 If you volunteer to participate in this study, the researcher will ask you to do the following:
 
 How long will I be in the research study?
					 Participation in the study will take a total of about one hour split during four sessions over a period of six months
					 Are there any potential risks or discomforts that I can expect from this study?
					 Some of the questions you will be asked will require you to give information that could potentially be uncomfortable to give. However, we have tried to minimize any such discomfort and you may select to take the surveys in as private an environment as you would like to minimize such effects further.
					 Are there any potential benefits if I participate?
					 There is no immediate benefit associated with participating in this study. However, the results of the research may help future treatment seekers by improving our ability to match them with services and also by informing future programs that can target specific recovery perceptions that may be found to delay treatment entry.
					 Will I receive any payment if I participate in this study?
					 You will receive gift certificates in the amount of $15, $10, $25, and $30 for your first, second, third, and final assessments respectively.
					 Will information about me and my participation be kept confidential?
					 Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can identify you will remain confidential. It will be disclosed only with your permission or as required by law. Confidentiality will be maintained by means of separating any identifying information from the data and securing the connecting file with the Principal investigator named above.
					 Withdrawal of participation by the investigator
					 
We have applied for a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health.
With this Certificate, the researcher cannot be forced to disclose information that may
identify you, even by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal,
administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. The researchers will use the Certificate to
resist any demands for information that would identify you, except as explained below.

					 
The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the
United States Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of Federally-funded
projects or for information that must be disclosed in order to meet the requirements of the
federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

					 
You should understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you or a
member of your family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your
involvement in this research. If an insurer, employer, or other person obtains your written
consent to receive research information, then the researchers may not use the Certificate
to withhold that information.

					 
The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the researchers from disclosing
voluntarily, without your consent, information you provide on current child/elder abuse that
is given to the researchers, or if there are threats to harm yourself or others, the
researchers will report this to the authorities.

					 
Confidentiality will be maintained by means of separating any identifying information from
the data and securing the connecting file with the Principal investigator named above.
						
						
					 What are my rights if I take part in this study?
					 You may withdraw your consent at any time and discontinue participation without penalty or loss of benefits to which you were otherwise entitled.  
					 
						You can choose whether or not you want to be in this study.  If you volunteer to be in this study, you may leave the study at any time without consequences of any kind.  You are not waiving any of your legal rights if you choose to be in this research study. You may refuse to answer any questions that you do not want to answer and still remain in the study.
					 Future use of data
					 Please check the appropriate box below and initial:
					 Financial disclosure
					 Dr. Jaffe, the principal investigator in the study, is also the owner of California Treatment Services, LLC., the company that owns the website www.allaboutaddiction.com. Your participation in the study is not expected to affect any income from the website and all work resulting from the study will include a disclosure as to Dr. Jaffe's financial interests in California Treatment Services, LLC.
					 
					Who can answer questions I might have about this study?	
					 In the event of a research related injury, please immediately contact one of the
researchers listed below.  If you have any questions, comments or concerns about the
research, you can talk to the one of the researchers. Please contact Dr. Adi Jaffe at (310)
267-5289 or by email at adi@ucla.edu..
					 If you wish to ask questions about your rights as a research participant or if you wish to
voice any problems or concerns you may have about the study to someone other than the
researchers, please call the Office of the Human Research Protection Program at (310)

We've detected that JavaScript is disabled in your browser. Would you like to proceed to legacy Twitter? Yes A lot of people get stuck because of fear or self-doubt. I can help you confidently pursue your dreams. #purelightpodcast Are you sure you want to view these Tweets? Viewing Tweets won't unblock @AiliKuutan Don't be afraid to be yourself. You don't have to be perfect in order to love yourself. The amount of self-love you experience is entirely up to you. Self-love is the ultimate form of self-healing. The most important relationship you'll ever have is the one you have with yourself. Dream bigger.

Try to fail.

Let yourself be surprised by who you are. Trying to protect yourself from failure eliminates the possibility of success. Aili Kuutan Retweeted Cheryl Strayed I totally understand this... I've experienced it myself. (And I haven't gotten to the point of completion on one yet.)https://twitter.com/CherylStrayed/status/1119275333021093888 … Aili Kuutan added, The language you use determines the outcomes you create. Facing your fears clears energetic and emotional clutter. What are you more likely to listen to: the voice of fear, or your heart? What are you more likely to question: the noise inside your head, or your worth? Magic tends to happen when you face the thing that scares you the most. Fear shows us the path that best serves our evolution. Facing it provides the greatest potential for personal growth. It’s scary how easy it can be to avoid fear. Are you feeding your doubt, or facing it? The true cost of self-doubt is high: it’s life as we want it. Only you have the power to change what you think and how you feel about yourself. Self-doubt is self-created. Hesitating fuels self-doubt. Truth resides in the heart.

Not everything that’s cool is right. What @LilNasX did with @tiktok_us is
what DJ Khaled did with Snapchat
what Soulja Boy did with Myspace
what Lil B did with Twitter

Viewing Tweets won't unblock @lannadelgrey This is the last place I ran alone & carefree. A thread on Mollie Tibbetts and running alone as a woman.pic.twitter.com/3V3XT28YUI This @lizzo album is EVERYTHING  We need more music like this. Most of all we need more women like Lizzo in music. pic.twitter.com/kbPQqSrDRH Ava DuVernay Retweeted When They See Us On this exact day 30 years ago, a woman was raped in Central Park. Five black + brown boys were framed for her rape. The story you know is the lie that police, prosecutors and Donald Trump told you. WHEN THEY SEE US is the story of the boys from their eyes and their hearts.https://twitter.com/whentheyseeus/status/1119268797410504704 … Ava DuVernay added, Some people are being wilfully stupid so let's break this down.

1.  Saying that you "wouldn't even rape" a person implies there are some people that you would rape. 

2.  "I wouldn't even rape her" or "Who'd rape you, anyway?" perpetuate the myth that rape is about attraction. Incredibly sad and difficult to share. In my experience, most people don’t want this knowledge, but not talking about these crimes only helps perpetrators. 19-year old Nusrat Jahan Rafi was burned to death for reporting sexual harassment, at her schoolhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47947117 … "The Only 13 Seconds That Mattered From William Barr’s Press Conference” was @ryanjreilly’s question!!http://bit.ly/2UKOVYY  White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told investigators she lied to the press after Comey firingpic.twitter.com/JNN9ObzKFd Nusrat Jahan Rafi was doused with kerosene & set on fire at her school in Bangladesh.

THEIR BOYFRIENDS: once almost made a dinner reservation but turns out the place was closed Emma Gray Retweeted ana marie cox someone should really let him know how much prettier he is when he smiles.https://twitter.com/anamariecox/status/1118886161127231488 … Emma Gray added, When men are not aware of their surroundings (& its usually not intentional) — they leave women to pick up the labor of toeing around public spaces to ensure men are comfortable. I know this sounds small & stupid. And some people may think I’m crazy. But it’s the small things that chip away at your sense of autonomy and ability to move around freely. Literally death by a thousand cuts. I’m so tired of working around men, especially during precious workout time, which is often my self care. I’ve already given up running because of two break ins and the threat of violence while running alone. A woman would *never* consistently behave this way. Because we’ve been conditioned to take in our environment, and adapt if need be. Why do you think I kept fucking apologizing so much. I’m trying to do squats and lunges alongside a 6foot tall man doing the same thing, in a very tiny space. One time I stepped on his foot. He looked at me like WTF?? I turned red, apologized immediately. Well, he didn’t realize and he certainly didn’t move. I shared this tiny 3-foot space with him (when there was a wide open space directly next to him that everyone could see) for the first half of class. Yesterday, the guy on the bench next to me consistently stood in my bench area. This is a common mistake in the class for first timers so I just shrugged it off and stood in my tiny area with him, assuming he’d realize and move. One time he got so close, I accidentally punched him. He looked back at me, pissed. I turned red and apologized immediately. He went back to taking up both our bags. My brain power the entire class was taken up as I tried to box essentially around this mad man taking up two bags. Last week, a guy was boxing on the bag next to me. He was hitting the bag so hard and trying to be so swaggy that he consistently kept backing up into my bag. There’s also the issue of space & male entitlement.

Starting this year, Anchorage seniors can wear traditional tribal regalia and objects of cultural significance — like sealskin graduation caps and leis — at their graduation ceremonies.   About 3,400 runners and walkers participated in one of Anchorage’s biggest spring flings, which this year came with snow berms.   The spending plan will fall between the proposal from the governor and House.  Critics of the rollback said it puts more Alaskans at risk of health problems from PFAS chemicals, which federal agencies say might increase the risk of cancer.  Eight bomb blasts rocked churches and luxury hotels in or near Sri Lanka’s capital on Easter Sunday — the deadliest violence the South Asian island country has seen since a bloody civil war ended a decade ago.  Nobody can say how it got there. But though the modern magic of social media, those who remember its glory days have shared the story of where it has been.   As administrations and Legislatures have come and gone, each has promised greater transparency and plain dealing when it comes to the state’s services and revenue.  Sladen Mohl, 19, was hit by an SUV driven by a teenager suspected of driving under the influence, according to police in Torrance.  In the plea agreement, the former Ketchikan High School teacher admitted to groping the teen multiple times between August and November 2017.   “Climate change is happening faster than it’s ever happened before in our record,” Utquiagvik-based NOAA scientist Bryan Thomas said. “We’re right in the middle of it.”  Alaska State Troopers say they don’t believe foul play was involved in his death, but the investigation is continuing.   Some seabirds can smell prey from up to 15 miles away.   Book review: “This Much Country” by Kristin Knight Pace joins a strong run of books by adventurous Alaska women.  Some residents in the northern part of the municipality have long dreamed of independence. Now a new group is hoping to rekindle the farewell fire.   Anchorage police received a report of a body found next to the library around 4:30 p.m. Friday, according to an alert.  The fire early Friday in Midtown was at least the third this year in an unoccupied or abandoned building.   Relationship advice: So what if you’re seven years in with no ring or proposal. The real question is, are you truly happy?

 I love the way each episode is a meditation on some aspect of a larger whole. Feels incredibly authentic and hits nail after nail on the head. Thanks for creating this. I love Soul Feed! Thank you Shannon for shining your light and sharing your inspiration and interviews! I am completely blown away by this podcast. I have to be transparent and say that I just came acroos your information today. I know that we both went to Syracuse University and I believe we have crossed paths in some way before. But I had no idea the amazing work that you do. I was scrolling thru my Facebook feed today and I came across your most recent Mediation video. I clicked on the link and the rest is history. I have to be open and say that I have never been apart of the Self-help community or ecperienced anything like this. After experiencing your meditation video I went about learning more about your work thru your website and then I came across this podcast. I have now spent the last few hours listening to Season 2 of Saul Feed and I have loved every minute of it. Your conversations are so insightful,  intelligent  and straight forward. Being a Teacher and a Performer I sometimes have great conversations that are insightful. Evan as a Ph.D. student I can sometimes have ground breaking conversations. But, just listening to your soft, careful and caring voice explain things that I negate so often in my life, makes me feel calm and open to all types of possibilites. I have to say that I am on the Shannon Algeo train and will continue to listen to your wonderful podcasts. Thank you for sharing your words with me and the world. Today was a big game changer for me. It really just takes a moment.

I’ll never forget, 6 years ago, finishing chemo with no voice right around Easter. Didn’t know if I’d ever sing again but I drew hope from Christ’s resurrection power to bring dead things back to life.  Today, a dream was fulfilled as I stood before my church and sang an original song and old gospel music praising Jesus’ name!   He will make a way for your suffering because he knows what suffering is. He gives new life to those who call upon his name because he conquered death!...   Thank you #God for showing us and bringing us back to your love. It’s a happy day! 😉 A special thanks to all the people out there who make others feel they are enough, no matter what. You help change the world! 🙏🏼

He was the first House member to introduce the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act. 

Yes, we will address the affordable housing crisis.https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/2019/04/19/bernie-sanders-south-carolina-rally-danny-glover-dr-cornel-west-affordable-housing-greenville-sc/3520397002/ … The efforts of Trump, Barr, Republicans in Congress, and Trump's many surrogates to paint this as some kind of "vindication" have been revealed as ridiculous in the extreme, even with the many redactions still in place. In short, every accusation against Trump and his staff appears to be borne out by the evidence and conclusions of the report. There is not one word of exoneration for Trump or any of those involved. This is as close to an absolute condemnation anyone could have anticipated. 5) Trump covered up both the timing and extent of his business dealings in Russia.
6) Members of the campaign knowingly shared information with Russian agents in hopes of gaining political advantage. 3) The campaign was involved directly in soliciting and distributing stolen goods.
4) Both Trump and the campaign obstructed justice, lied to investigators, lied to Congress, destroyed evidence, and impeded the investigation in every way possible. What the actual Mueller report says, is *exactly* what everyone following this case from the outset predicted:
1) Russia was out to help Trump, and regarded his victory as a win for them.
2) Trump's campaign welcomed and accepted Russia's help. Am told that Warren, who was flying back to Boston from Salt Lake City yesterday, began reading the redacted Mueller report on the plane. She continued reading into the night after getting home, and when she was finished, felt it was her “duty” publicly say what she just tweeted The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty. That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States. To ignore a President’s repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country, and it would suggest that both the current and future Presidents would be free to abuse their power in similar ways. Mueller put the next step in the hands of Congress: “Congress has authority to prohibit a President’s corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.” The correct process for exercising that authority is impeachment. The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help. Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack. Democrats are gonna end up doing the right thing because we are gonna make them do it.https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5cba1934e4b068d795cc45b5 … Trump, Hillary & Bernie all campaigned to allow Americans to buy low-cost drugs from Canada & other countries & require Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices. These policies are in the Dem platform. It's shameful they haven't passed the House yet.https://www.statnews.com/2019/04/15/democrats-feud-over-drug-pricing-policy/ … Even ⁦@ConorLambPA⁩ ran on Medicare negotiating drug prices. It is a no brainer for Democrats to back ⁦@RepLloydDoggett⁩ bill. @TopherSpiro⁩ saying it’s “controversial” is funny. Of course taking on Big Pharma will be controversial!https://www.statnews.com/2019/04/15/democrats-feud-over-drug-pricing-policy/ … While I understand the political reality of the Senate + election considerations, upon reading this DoJ report, which explicitly names Congress in determining obstruction, I cannot see a reason for us to abdicate from our constitutionally mandated responsibility to investigate. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Retweeted The Washington Post Mueller’s report is clear in pointing to Congress’ responsibility in investigating obstruction of justice by the President.

It is our job as outlined in Article 1, Sec 2, Clause 5 of the US Constitution.

As such, I’ll be signing onto @RashidaTlaib’s impeachment resolution.https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1118956587475963904 … Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez added, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Retweeted Michael Deibert As it turns out, Rep.

“I use all my tools, including myself, because I am an open individual who is not closed off to the possibilities of what life offers and why we are here.” - Alexandra Holzer, Second Generation Ghost Hunter
- Actor and Writer Dan Aykroyd says Dr. Hans Holzer inspired him to do the popular classic film, Ghostbusters.  

“I became obsessed by Hans Holzer, the greatest ghosthunter ever. That’s when the idea of my film Ghostbusters was born."



 
A century ago, renouned Parapsychologist Hans Holzer changed the face of paranormal research and investigation forever. And while the torch he lit is an essential one to carry, it’s an important point to note that it’s never ceased. THIS LEGACY and the LINEAGE carry on thru myself as I help countless beings living and dead understand the field of Physical Research AKA...The PARANORMAL.

Sacramento:pic.twitter.com/LMzPBYMzSA A gentle and honest victory is what all migrants, refugees, seek. 

Not crying.https://open.spotify.com/track/61dYvvfIRtIDFuqZypPAta?si=SHWooBhdSYCiBf2j4F9PLA … Adding a conversation about immigration to a piece that evokes that sort of contemplation is brilliant, not only because it forces vulnerability on an issue that stirs passions, but because the music itself crescendoes to a gentle and honest victory. It’s been wonderfully explored by many musicians, but @YoYo_Ma at age 63 has figured it out. 

He’s realized the piece can stop time and capture large spaces

The piece demands focus on the meandering journey of the cello & almost forces a reflection on our own journey. I don’t think I’ll ever feel more connected to any piece of music than I do the Bach Cello Suite No.1 

It’s poignant and vulnerable.

It grounds me, it brings me joy, I rediscover it every time I hear it.

Whether you're on an athletic team, in a marching band, a member of a small business, or A SCHOOL FACULTY, this powerful idea can improve CULTURE- IF EVERYONE follows it.

Back in 1986, a friend took me to a restaurant on Bedford Street in New York City’s Greenwich Village. That first meal at Shopsin’s converted me.  Back then I lived three blocks away so I often went daily. It was either breakfast (hashed browns with veggies and       poached eggs.) Or lunch (creamed tuna on toast.) Or dinner ((fried spaghetti—a crispy crossover between pizza and     hash brown pancakes). The encyclopedic menu listed hundreds of down-home favorites from every corner of the   globe, more variety than in any other restaurant. On each visit, I read and deliberated over every single menu item, despite my preference for a handful of dishes that I    usually wound up ordering. Both the menu and the dishes, quirky, flavorful, and unabashed,  were concoctions of an   zealous cook in an old world kitchen.

Fifty-percent of the experts reviewed a paper in which the drug “hydroxycitrate” was named as the active ingredient, while an otherwise identical paper reviewed by the other half of the peer review group listed the active ingredient as the homeopathic remedy, sulfur.     Read More   → What’s the difference between health prevention, health care, and public health? Health prevention tries to address the causes of health imbalance and disease. Health care treats an individual after symptoms or disease manifests. Public health tries to remove disease contributors— that affect all people. The bottom line is that some health concerns must be addressed through health care and making the right personal health choices. But some disease contributors can only be addressed by modifying societal health choices. Let’s first clarify the difference between personal and societal health choices— and the connection between them. On the personal level, if my friend, Ralph chooses to regularly over-eat foods known to produce gain weight, his personal decision may drive him towards obesity. On the societal level, if corporate influence, regulations, laws, subsidies, and social policies make fattening foods cheap and available, then these policies will drive Ralph— and millions of others— towards weight gain and obesity.

As Dr. Joseph Pizzorno (co-founder of Bastyr University) and other prominent physicians point to the unintentional damage wrought by agricultural and industrial toxins, the assumption that all chemical combinations are good for us, or can be managed by our detox systems is being revealed as false. Yet the mainstream media lags behind in telling the true story. For example, in a press teleconference I attended, three researchers revealed the current (and highly disturbing findings) on chemical toxins as contributors to rising cancer rates in young children. All of the scientific researchers spoke about the need to regulate the 80,000 toxic chemicals that have never been studied or regulated since they were “grandfathered” into common use in 1975. After the scientists spoke,  “Wendy,” a young mother recounted how her daughter died of cancer before the age of four. This caring mother was traumatized by this tragedy, as most people would be.  I felt sad and puzzled observing the blind spot this true story evoked in media folks. The truth of this story was unacceptable to their predefined “rules” about how to convey this information. Several major media reporters at the conference set about translating for their readers this worrisome information and its call to action. A reporter for a major and well-regarded online health media website heard the tragic story of Wendy’s young daughter’s death from brain cancer, and asked, “Of course we don’t want to scare our readers, so what can we tell them they can do about this?”    Read More   → Listen to Dr. David M. Brady, ND discuss his new book, The Fibro-Fix: Get to the Root of Your Fibromyalgia and Start Reversing Your Chronic Pain and Fatigue in 21 Days to learn why a combination of toxins, stress, and abuse are producing an epidemic in conversation with Alison Rose Levy.

From the get-go, conventional medicine’s signature promise was to help humans kill infections and wipe out invading bacteria via antibiotics and vaccines.But research over the last decade reveals that fighting germs with antibiotics, injecting antibiotics into livestock animals, and dousing ourselves, our homes, and our environment with antibacterial toothpastes, cleansers, and soaps may turn out to be a misguided, producing long term health consequences.

Wilma Subra has studied the biological impacts of industrial and naturally occurring chemicals for over twenty-five years. When chemical spills or toxic industrial releases affect unsuspecting communities, Subra — a distinguished microbiologist and chemist — often gets called in to investigate. Her experiences have taught her that the contamination of communities and waterways is just part of doing business for multinational corporations and it is becoming a significant, growing byproduct of our current, poorly regulated industrial practices.

No craving/no high/no tolerance/no pattern of compulsive use.

But antidepressants do definitely cause withdrawal symptoms in some people-easily confused with relapse.

But often make the mistake of believing their bad experience is universal.

All controlled studies rest on untested assumption that findings from large groups can be directly applied to individuals.

Study shows this is untrue bec of great individual variation.

Greatly improving the simple stuff would save many more loves than all the glittering new toys.https://twitter.com/lisabdixon/status/1119284707152232448 … Allen Frances added, Really great that major media are trumpeting the grave risks of over-testing/overdiagnosis H& over-treatment.

Too much treatment is destroying America's health.https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/19/715113208/why-do-doctors-overtreat-for-many-its-what-they-re-trained-to-do … Families also have lived experience that deserves attention.

OK to attack psychiatry if harmed or not helped by it. 

But wrong to attack family members who support involuntary treatment because sometimes only way to prevent #suicide/jail/homelessness/lost jobs & relationships.

Workshop, Media & Communications, Innovation & Technology  Friday, Dec 5, 2014 
9:30 am – 1:00 pm 
1776 DC1133 15 St NW, 12th floor, Washington, DC(map)
 This is a mixed format session that includes a group workshop followed by an optional private consultation. You'll gain important insights from the workshop and then have the opportunity to work with the instructor to tailor this knowledge just for you. Do you feel like there’s something more you can do with your life but aren’t sure how to make that happen? Do you want to live in a way that feels more aligned with what matters to you? Wherever you are on your journey, this workshop is designed to guide you on making the changes you want in life. In this interactive session, we will: Before you leave, you will be able to identify the most critical steps in bringing this life into reality today. To help us arrive at a robust and concrete plan, we will apply the fundamentals of two frameworks: You don’t have to be from a specific industry to attend this session and no prior experience with these frameworks required. All disciplines and organizations are encouraged to participate and explore this workshop. The main part of this workshop is a 2.5 hour group session where you will explore and apply tools to design your optimal future. This highly interactive session connects you with fellow participants to co-create pieces of the exercises. Following this workshop, you have an opportunity to apply for an individual consulting session with the instructor, where you will explore in-depth the specific steps to execute the plan you just created. Class instructor and leadership life coach, Allie Armitage will offer a deeply discounted 45-minute private sessions for six participants following the workshop. In this session you will dive further into your plan and explore its implementation. You will also identify the roadblocks that could hold you back and you'll gain a firm understanding of how your strengths can be harnessed to navigate around these challenges.      Those who sign up a private session may work from 1776 co-working space in the afternoon. Design Thinking is an innovation process that uses the designer’s toolkit to create solutions that are both meaningful and usable in the world. With a goal of generating ideas or insights we’ve never considered before, the Design Thinking cycle is a 5-step process that starts by developing a deep understanding of users (in this case ourselves). Then, after zeroing in on the most compelling and powerful need, the process explores a wide range of possibilities to solve it and emphasizes the building of test "prototypes" to gather feedback on how effective the concept actually is. The solutions are improved with feedback, rebuilt and tested repeatedly until an effective and proven end result is reached. Emotional intelligence (often abbreviated as EQ, EI, or EIQ) is the ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions. Studies have found that EQ is often a much stronger determinant of success than IQ or expertise. The great news is that EQ is a learned skill - it is not genetically fixed and it can continue to be developed as we go through life. Our competence in it can keep growing as we deepen our awareness and apply this knowledge in new ways. You can learn more about the importance of emotional intelligence in this Harvard Business Review post by Daniel Goldman. Allie Armitage has a passion for the intersection of creativity + personal transformation. She owns an entrepreneurial design firm called Mind Into Matter, where she helps clients unlock their drive and motivation and use business tools to build their life around it. She is as an adjunct professor at the University of Maryland's Academy for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and she leads Design Thinking workshops for General Assembly, Linktank, and many other outlets. Allie got her start on this path in 2007, when she co-founded a company called weBike to offer simple, affordable bike sharing for college campuses. After learning how the tools of design apply directly to a tangible business, she gained insight into the personal leadership journey for entrepreneurs working at the Entrepreneur’s Organization and Netcito. She now leads her own practice facilitating workshops and coaching ambitious leaders to apply these methods toward leading non-traditional, meaningful lives. Your session has been tagged for review. Thank you for your feedback! Our team will investigate this issue as soon as possible.

Today's digital tools—including but not limited to e-mail, the Web, cell phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), even iPods—promote interactivity and connectedness.  But as Momentum shows, these new social media tools are important not for their wizardry but because they connect us to one another in inexpensive, accessible, and massively scalable ways. Fine outlines strategies for "connected activism" in this idealistic, lucidly written account about using the Internet to build up networks among activists who can pool information and other resources to help create lasting solutions that address the roots of social problems. Citing organizations such as the advocacy group MoveOn.org and MeetUp.com, which promotes off-line gatherings like those that propelled the Dean for President campaign, Fine emphasizes a mind-set of self-determination among citizens and two-way rather than top-down communication from organizations. She takes a cue from the 1999 "Cluetrain Manifesto," aimed at corporations that were out of touch with consumers, translating its promotion of digital communication to the activist sphere. Some of her rhetoric seems hyperbolic, as when she suggests that online activism provides a neutral playing field in which women can advance their causes without getting dismissed because of their gender, and she pushes hard on the readiness of "plugged-in" Generation Y to change the world. On the whole, though, she provides activists with effective guidelines for streamlining the pursuit of social change through instant messaging, blogs, chat rooms and Blackberries.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

					    	 "...a fresh, zestful way of thinking about and organizing social change work." (PublicNet.co.uk, October 9, 2008) Thoughtful and thought provoking, which addresses technology strategies, relationships, and organizational change within the nonprofit sector. Far from a technical manual, it raises compelling issues that deserve consideration by all nonprofit organizations. (Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 05/01/2008) Fine (founder, Innovation Network, Inc.), a New York social entrepreneur, writes on the way new social media-the Internet, cell phones, digital tools-allow activists to create new groupings of self-directed and self-responsible progressives. She believes that in this new connected era of the Internet, activist networks trump hierarchy, and she touches on how social media have already facilitated progressive actions. She points out the need for activists and progressive organizations to harness the new technologies while genuinely listening to those engaged in the new social media. She also ponders the future of activism in a connected age. This work contains some practical-and even inspiring-advice but is really a meditation on the interaction between technology and traditional activism. Most useful in academic and large public libraries.

 We’ll spend this summer on Gotland, which is a small Island in the middle of the baltic sea. It’s where we both grew up and where our families live. Our plan is to learn how to grow our own food, and to enjoy the summer together with friends and family. If you happen to pass by Gotland, let us know!  To this date we’ve planted: … and more! Let us know if you have any tips or ideas for how to do gardening.
We’ll post occasional updates here, while we’ll post much more often over at our Swedish blog Mangolandet.se.  Obviously, I didn’t know what it would be like to give birth to a baby. Still, I stayed so convinced throughout my pregnancy that it would be a wonderful experience, and I was surprised to see how many of my girlfriends that came to me and asked me if I wasn’t scared to death. I wasn’t. But all I could do was to give them my personal thoughts about giving birth in general, not knowing if and how they would change when it actually happened. Now I know, and my thoughts haven’t changed a bit. It makes me concerned to see that plenty of young women believe it must be horrible to give birth since I know most of them want to have children. Therefore I’d like to share my experience with you. It seems to be the fear of pain that scares people the most. I’ve used three helpful thoughts when it comes to going through the pain: 1, The pain itself doesn’t have to be a bad thing, only pain in combination with fear is damaging and traumatic. I read a lot about this in “Att möta förlossningssmärtan” (“Facing the labor pains”) by the Swedish midwife and author Gudrun Abascal, a book I highly recommend. Unfortunately there is no English version yet, only Swedish.   2, No matter how painful it might be, the time of the actual delivery is a fractional part of the looong pregnancy. You’re at the finish line! 3, Every single person on Earth has been born. I kept this in mind every time a walked through a big crowd through my pregnancy. Imagine how many successful births that is!
 And really, I never found the pain any worse than that I’ve been looking forward to doing it again form the very second our daughter was born. I’m therefore convinced that anybody can manage even the most painful situation – as long as you don’t panic. I didn’t use any medical pain relief either, since the whole process was over in a few hours and I felt alright with just a heating pad and some hot towels. Though I think it’s great that all sorts of pain relief is accessible in modern hospitals, I believe it might make you even more afraid of how much it would hurt WITHOUT medical help, since no pain killers will numb the pain completely.  Another aspect that makes me critical towards using medical pain relief is that I’m not sure I would have felt completely how much and when to push or to take a break etc. And I found this to be the most fascinating part of the process – my body told me EXACTLY what to do and I just had to string along. Somehow I think that makes baby delivering one of the easiest things a woman can do, funny enough! And no matter what happens when you give birth, I’m sure the pride, love and relaxation you feel once you can finally hold your baby in your hand for the first time is the same. I’d be incredibly happy if I could inspire a future mother or two who might feel anxious about giving birth. I look at my one month old daughter who I’m breastfeeding while i write, and I happily confirm my overwhelming conviction from early in the the pregnancy: Giving birth to her was absolutely wonderful.  We are proud to finally welcome our daughter Kima Heijbel to the world!
Born in Stockholm on December 26, 3160 g and 49 cm tall.
We’re spending an amazing first month together.
The biggest adventure of our lives has begun.
And truthfully, it has never been better!  It’s been over 9 months since we got back from Pakistan and settled for a while in Stockholm, and our baby moved into my belly. Made him/herself comfortable and became the third part of our family. Now that we’re no more than two days (!) from due date, I reflect a lot upon the different kind of adventure that we’ve had the privilege to meet this year.   Travelling around the world is a big challenge. Constantly meeting new people, new scenarios, adjust, adapt, stay alert, keep the energy and passion even if your money run out or you loose your way. But in a way I find all that very easy, very natural. When we’re on the move, we are also “served” with experiences. Automatically fascinated and amused by the world around us as we gain new skills and knowledge. I’m not saying travelling is only easy, but it’s part of a travelers nature  to discover and soak up the new atmosphere. Inspired to tell, to write, to share and learn.  Since March when we moved to Stockholm and started working regular jobs again, we’ve obviously been a lot more stationary. Especially due to the pregnancy and me vomiting 15 times a day for a few months. That makes me philosophize about what’s more challenging; to travel the world or to stay just as inspired in your daily, stationary life? Both, I’m sure, in their own ways as the grass often seems to be greener on the other side. For me personally right now, I know the answer :) ! Make no mistake; I am incredibly happy and I’m doing excellent. We are so excited to meet our baby that our apartment shivers, and I absolutely LOVE living the life I live right now! All I want is to remind you all including myself for the new year ahead, that making your weekdays feel fresh and new is a challenge worth credit. To keep lifting your chin above the wall, to keep looking AROUND the corner you pass every day on your way home from work, that takes some effort.  We are inspired by our friends, by making bread and baking cakes, by our mango baby plant, meeting couchsurfers (although it’s been a while now), picking mushrooms in Gotland and spending time with each other and the kicking belly. What ever you do in your daily life,  it will be just as much fun as YOU make it! Merry Christmas to those of you who will celebrate it and a happy new year to all you njaros out there!  Amanda  What is good luck?
From a philosophic perspective, you could say that “luck” doesn’t exist. That there are no such things as having good or bad luck. Many people who were impressed as we returned from Pakistan also told us that we had had “a lot of good luck”.  From one point of view, they might have been right. You might consider good luck as when a situation where you are totally out of control still turns out well. Like, you meet a black mamba but it doesn’t bite you, or somebody tries to rob you but you don’t loose any valuables. But more likely is that the mamba doesn’t bite you cause you didn’t freak out enough to offend the animal. Or you’d been smart not to carry any loose money or wear any jewelry worth steeling.  Meaning, it’s not your “good luck” that saves you, it’s a matter of your behavior. 
You surely COULD get hit by a car while crossing the road, but most of the times you’d prevent this by looking carefully before crossing. Yes, we are very lucky that nothing incredibly bad happened to us along our way from Poland to Pakistan, and many other times in life as well. But was it just fate sending us a few hundred amazing people to pick us up as we hitchhiked, or did our attitude and choice of behavior also bring out the best of the people we met?  You are mightier than you might think. You are in position to drive, change and affect what happens to you. Break down negative destiny. Create a new one that suits you.   Two pop delicious, dance loving Swedes who have finished a mission: 
We've hitchhiked over 25 000 km and returned to Sweden in 2011!

“Though we can understand the enthusiasm for Game of Thrones now that the final season has arrived, we still prefer our intellectual property not be used for political purposes.” The Special Counsel found evidence of crimes outside its scope and made 14 criminal referrals to other jurisdictions. Only 2 of them are known to date.https://nyti.ms/2IAdIHU  Mueller report: We’re not going to use the term “collusion” bc it’s not "a specific offense or theory of liability."

The Turpins are sentenced to 25 years to life in prison after their children testify about years of torturehttps://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/us/turpin-parents-sentencing-friday/index.html … Areva Martin, Esq. Retweeted Peter Baker This tho....#MuellerDayhttps://twitter.com/peterbakernyt/status/1119202111693230081 … Areva Martin, Esq. added, The reporting and analysis of the #MuellerReport continues. Unbelievable day when the American people have to accept that the President not only lies constantly but that he bullies his staff into lying and ignores Russian interference in US elections. My take on @CNN The #MuellerReport doesn’t exonerate Trump and #BillBarr spin can’t change fact that people lied, destroyed evidence and used encrypted communications in stunning ways that compel Congress, not Barr, to resolve! #BillBarr refused to answer questions about the fact that he was spinning Mueller Report and then in the most arrogant way possible, he walked out! And BTW—Lawyers don’t use word “collusion” it’s not a legal term! This guy used it 6x. But it is Trump’s favorite word! #BarrCoverUp #BillBarr has lost all credibility and is a complete Trump lacky. His theory about obstruction is laughable. It goes like this—Trump was mad at the Dems for undermining him, so every tweet, threat & act of obstruction couldn’t be obstruction because he had a right to be mad! SMH #BillBarr makes false claim that he is committed to transparency and then cherry pick portions of report that favor Trump and support his cry “of no collusion.” Barr repeatedly states “no collusion” as he proves his loyalty to Trump not US people. #ReleaseTheFullUnredactedReport BREAKING: Florida DA said they will release video of #Patriots owner #RobertKraft in spa sex trafficking sting. His lawyers say it’s a violation of his constitutional rights. My take next @CNN Missing Cambridge Man Found Safe | NBC10 Boston.

Up,

What I thought had been a non-reply turned out to be (after I followed up) a "yes! let's make this happen" email gone astray.

Thank you @MorriganMcC & @kerrimac!pic.twitter.com/7Gjbq4wNd5 There’s a building on the corner 
made of thick stone. 
Layer upon layer, each year adds up. 
I feel safe there, protected. 

But every once in awhile, the wind shifts and I can feel the structure swaying, fragile. Splits in the rock, 
not enough glue. 

Never enough glue. maybe hope is a world where
the flowers are our children - 
deeply rooted, bloom of soil ..
Maybe the petals fall
like faith

fleeting, feeling for some
opening

the field believes tomorrow will
rise

and so do I

but faith, that’s our line, how can inability make time

to kneel, feel failure
fly

back, follow all 
the birds

..
#vss365 #poetry #mpy Our vices lie
plentiful
in groves of
perfection and
no one recalls the dishes 
done, how we 
won
some place
somewhere 

you come
inside our homes
our vacant churches
you come
pulling up pink 
clouds
hanging love
above us

little droves 
blind in the
glory

 #vss365 #poem #poetry ...
I never thought I’d find myself
here in the dandelions
where gold drifts through all living things
veiling the green in speckled quilts
of insistent flowers
the cow tongues graze over 
this acceptance 
but I’m
celebrating
my
borderless heaven 

 #vss365 #poem #poetry ...
the day flings confetti
green buds flutter 

point upward, despite
our downward
shuffle

we hover in a breeze, wonder at the ease of another season

how could so much sit
in millions of tips,

green trust steady 

in all this 
saving us, again
 #BlackDahliaProse #poetry #poem She took hold of me
Took me aside

Told me,
I could be a butterfly

Said I hadn't really died

Told me,
I could be
Whatever I want to be

Then she released me

Watched the fluttering pieces
Come to life

I'm now a husband
She's my wife

though I bend down

finger a leaf
tip my chin into the

who stole all of this blue hope
from me, the other day

I can’t touch the light
but here it

touches me
saves all my shadows

in holy pockets of
eternity

someone painted the blades of the meadow

and all the arms of brush cleared colors I won’t glimpse
any another morning

I can sense my smile stroked thick
enough to take me on

at least to the end
of the farm, to the buttercups, and back
...
#poem #poetry
#12monthsofink #mpy In the realm of survival
there is a revival for the quiet ones
a revolution in unspoken words
we never understood,
love was a master
but I played truant

now I'm returning stealthily
following your scent on the wind
til I'm forgiven,
this territory of art
~ my awakening.

#poetry Beneath my Veneer,

I'm an asylum seeker

fleeing my own past

seeking a sanctuary, 

a safe house for my

heart, in a World that

is indifferent towards

me.

#vss365pic.twitter.com/qOx8BcO3s4 we say
"beloved" 
to sway nostalgia

rich swirl
of words the
weight of centuries

trading 
ounce for pound
each ton for shame

the shine on
golden symbols
steers us back. I used to fear 
that I’d die alone 
and now I fear 
that I won’t; 
the last image of 
someone you love 
in pain
knowing 
you are the reason
has to be worse
than anything after. effacing itself 
against the glow of sunset 
a pigeon-breast cloud how low 
the moon
one of us
is lonely There are wounds
we learn to live with,
seas of sorrow
we learn to swim.
There are dreams
we learn to bury,
deaths that teach us
to rise again.

Speaker, international bestselling author, psychotherapist, @Forbes & @Inc columnist Are you sure you want to view these Tweets? Viewing Tweets won't unblock @AmyMorinLCSW Want to know the secret to becoming mentally strong? Check out my #TEDx talk https://youtu.be/TFbv757kup4  #resilience #psychology If you could go back in time and give your 18 year old self a piece of advice, what would you say? One of the most common misconceptions about mental strength is that an illness, like depression or anxiety, is a sign of weakness.⁣
⁣
Mental strength and mental health are two separate… https://www.instagram.com/p/BwVDVxIlBpb/?utm_source=ig_twitter_share&igshid=kbto7pxsinei … To reach your greatest potential. you have to believe that you're worthy of your achievement. https://www.inc.com/amy-morin/5-ways-to-banish-the-belief-that-youre-not-good-enough.html …pic.twitter.com/jRYpEo29Ok Lifting weights improves physical strength but doesn't guarantee you won't develop a physical illness, like cancer. Mental strength is the same. Building mental muscle improves mental health but doesn't guarantee you won't ever get depression. Illness isn't a weakness. Rather than waste time and energy asking yourself, "Why is this happening to me," ask, "What can I do about it?" #MentallyStrong What are some books that influenced your life? Amy Morin, LCSW Retweeted Flipboard I'm excited to see my article is featured by Flipboard!https://twitter.com/Flipboard/status/1116157418931617795 … Amy Morin, LCSW added, I was the "shy kid." What was your childhood label? https://www.inc.com/amy-morin/why-your-childhood-label-is-so-hard-to-shake.html … @Inc Mental strength isn't always about what you do. Sometimes, it's more about what you DON'T do. Here's why. https://www.inc.com/amy-morin/i-studied-mentally-strong-people-for-15-years-discovered-they-all-had-this-one-thing-in-common.html … @Inc Sometimes people confuse positive thinking with magical thinking. Your mind doesn't magically make good things happen. You have to combine positive thinking with positive action to get real results. #MentallyStrong Your brain will underestimate you and try to convince you that you can't do hard things. But just because you think something, doesn't mean it's true. Don't believe everything you think. #mentallystrongpic.twitter.com/scDuPoVKO7 I decided to get serious about Instagram a couple of months ago and I'm glad I did. It's been great for my business. Here are the steps I took to gain 10K followers fast. 
https://www.inc.com/amy-morin/%E2%80%8Bhow-i-got-my-first-10k-instagram-followers-5-things-that-really-worked.html … @Inc Although circumstances may change in the blink of an eye, people change at a slower pace. Even motivated people who welcome change often encounter stumbling blocks that make transformation more complicated than they'd originally anticipated. #MentallyStrong The exercises that build mental muscle are the same for men and women, society encourages women to engage in counterproductive bad habits that rob them of mental strength. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-mentally-strong-people-dont-do/201904/13-things-mentally-strong-women-dont-do … @PsychToday Amy Morin, LCSW Retweeted Sharifah Nadirah Thank you!https://twitter.com/snsza94/status/1114003158013886464 … Amy Morin, LCSW added, I really like this article about how to review a book. As an author, I agree it's one of the best ways you can support someone's book. I so appreciate everyone who has taken the time to review my books!http://www.nancyherkness.com/2016/05/11/i-loved-the-book-but-how-do-i-write-a-review/ … In his new post, a counter-intuitive but very helpful suggestion by @Leadershipfreak titled, "How to be a Great Pretender." Be sure and see @AmyMorinLCSW's wonderful quote at the end! http://bit.ly/2TXmvFI  #leadership I used to teach people to do this in my therapy office all the time. Yet, I almost forgot to practice it in my own life. https://www.inc.com/amy-morin/how-changing-way-i-breathe-helped-me-conquer-my-fear-of-public-speaking-shaved-a-minute-off-my-mile-run.html … @Inc Phyllis Fagell, LCPC Retweeted INSIDER "To talk to her students about their mental health, HS teacher Erin Castillo created a chart w/ sections ranging from 'I'm great' to 'I'm in a really dark place." Students write their name on the back of a sticky note & place it in the section that best describes how they feel."https://twitter.com/thisisinsider/status/1113170511217942528 … Phyllis Fagell, LCPC added, I was late to the Instagram game and I had no idea what to post. So I experimented and these are the things that helped me get 10K followers fast. https://www.inc.com/amy-morin/%E2%80%8Bhow-i-got-my-first-10k-instagram-followers-5-things-that-really-worked.html … @Inc

Making the conscious decision to bring youth into this would only further exacerbate issues of body image, eating disorders and self esteem. #WakeUpWeightWatchers #eliminatedietculturehttps://twitter.com/cbccanada/status/969500146147917824 … Allison Jackson  🍁 added, The cost is not free. The cost is ruining the chances of your child having a healthy relationship with food. #WakeUpWeightWatchers We warn kids about the dangers of smoking and drinking.

#wakeupweightwatchers You don’t recover from perfectionism, perfectly!

America’s leading expert on the masculine self






In Challenging Casanova, noted expert on teenage and adult masculine behavior Andrew Smiler debunks the stereotype that teenage boys and young men are barely able to control their sex drives; he argues this belief may lead to destructive hyper-sexuality, unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted diseases. Dr. Smiler’s goal is to help us all recognize that boys’ sexual development is multi-faceted and to give us the tools we need to keep the stereotype from becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. The author also shows how this shift in attitude could help create young men who are more mature and have better relationships with partners and friends. Challenging Casanova: This book dismantles the stereotypes of boys as driven only by an obsession with having intercourse with multiple partners, and calls for deeper growth and understanding of modern masculinity.

While the rich world braces for future climate change, the poor world is already being devastated by it @CNNIhttps://cnn.it/2FGT85C  "Nowhere do climate change stories come across more powerfully than in the polar extremes of the Antarctic and Arctic." Update from our co-founder @jonathonporritt on the ground >http://ow.ly/sqPF30okm82  India has tendered 35GW of low cost #solar alone in the last year. Not one new import coal plant has been built in half a decade. The 10GW of Gujarat import coal power plants at Mundra just received a $18bn bailout, too expensive.

Dear DFPI Supporters,  Since February of 2013, we at Dietitians For Professional Integrity have been a voice for uplifting the registered dietitian credential at a time when corporate influences - both overt and covert - have been deeply entrenched in nutrition science.  When DFPI was created, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics had Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, General Mills, and Kellogg as partners. Now, five years later, those partnerships are gone and Coca-Cola no longer has a boo...th at the annual conference expo hall.  Our external advocacy efforts were needed in 2013 to help catalyze change. Even in 2015 (when the Academy announced a partnership between the Kids Eat Right Foundation and Kraft Singles) and 2017 (when an Academy presidential nominee with industry ties was on the ballot) there was a need for concerned dietitians to unify and have their voices heard -- and they were!  DFPI helped normalize dietitian dissent within the Academy, which, for decades, led to members experiencing marginalization and subtle shunning.   The landscape, however, has shifted over the past few years. Although there is still work to be done, egregious examples of corporate influence within the Academy are far less common.  As a result, we believe the advocacy focus needs to shift to a more internal lens. Academy members need to run for office and, within the existing framework, advocate for change.   External advocacy has its limits. In that sense, DFPI has completed the work it set out to do five and a half years ago. We contributed our grain of sand to make corporate sponsorship and industry influence a mainstream topic that can no longer be ignored or brushed off as the concerns of a small minority.  After carving out a path of advocacy for half a decade, we now encourage our colleagues at the Academy to 'take the baton' and keep the spirit of change alive in their own groups and communities. A lot has been accomplished over the last five years; the tides of change are inevitable.  While this marks the end of an era, each of us at DFPI deeply cares about this issue and is available to provide guidance and mentorship for dietitians looking to bring about change.  Our website (integritydietitians.org) is an excellent resource of information - and will remain available for many years (funded by our remaining operating funds).  Please note that, as of June 30, we no longer accept donations for advocacy efforts.  We look forward to seeing the next wave of changes our colleagues will usher in over the coming years to propel our beloved profession forward.  Thank you, again, for your support over the past five years.  Sincerely,  Andy Bellatti, MS, RD Denise Garbinski, MBA, RD Jess Kolko, RD Elizabeth Lee, MS, RD David Wiss, MS, RDN Good read on how highly processed foods (and the ingredients in many of them) can negatively impact health by creating an imbalance in the gut microbiome. This is the future of nutrition. The fact that an additive isn't carcinogenic doesn't necessarily mean it's benign. https://www.nytimes.com/…/germs-microbes-processed-foods.ht…

 Armed with guns and badges but little training, civilian officers provide a less-expensive alternative for law enforcement agencies. But problems at some local departments help illustrate a controversial issue shaded by nepotism, politics and questionable policing.   Experts and judges question the quality of fingerprint analysis by Chicago police forensics, hampering prosecutions in burglary and theft cases.   Un análisis hecho por BGA/Medill revela que las acciones de vigilancia para el cumplimiento de la ley ambiental disminuyeron bajo los dos mandatos del alcalde. El número de inspectores se recortó cuando el alcalde redujo costos.   A BGA/Medill analysis shows environmental enforcement declined under the two-term mayor. City inspection staff was slashed as mayor cut costs.   Illinois is one of just nine states that tax income at a flat rate. But a graduated tax system alone doesn’t guarantee the wealthy pay a higher rate.   There has been a major decline in the share of Chicago high schoolers who smoke cigarettes, but the city doesn't come close to leading the nation.  From our president Policy Civic engagement Our organization  As Illinois debates whether to raise taxes on the rich, IRS data show better off tax filers stayed put when flat tax rates jumped a few years ago despite fears so called job creators would leave the state to avoid paying the increase.   Talk of new Chicago and Downstate casinos is resurfacing among politicians as an answer to government fiscal woes. But casino revenue is off sharply from its heights, and the industry is struggling to attract younger gamblers.   There is often a disconnect between tax policies voters say they back and those they vote for. That’s the dilemma facing Gov.-elect J.B. Pritzker, who says he wants to amend the state constitution to allow for a graduated tax that will increase the burden on the wealthy.   The mayor eliminated environmental enforcement office to cut costs, which a recent BGA investigation revealed resulted in declines in inspections and citations. Now both potential successors support bringing the department back as support builds in City Council.   The Chicago school district also is paying out more than $100,000 to a special education teacher who says he lost his job after raising concerns about special ed staffing issues at the same Southwest Side high school.   Ordinance will force developers and building owners that receive public funds to give notice, create a plan and communicate with residents before rehabs occur.  Better Government Association

Green Is The New Red The SHAC 7 were convicted on “animal enterprise terrorism” charges for campaigning to shut down a notorious animal testing lab, Huntingdon Life Sciences. Huntingdon Life Sciences has labs in New Jersey and England, and five undercover investigations have shown workers punching beagle puppies in the face, dissecting live monkeys and falsifying scientific data. Activists with Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, an international organization, set out to close the lab using tactics similar to the anti-apartheid movement: they pressured business associated with the lab to sever ties, in what the government has called “tertiary targeting.” The “terrorist” campaign of the SHAC 7 didn’t involve anthrax, pipe bombs, or a plot to hijack an airplane. They ran a website. On that website, they posted news about the campaign — legal actions like protests and illegal actions like stealing animals from labs — and unabashedly supported all of it. Since the federal government has largely been unable catch groups like the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front, prosecutors went after lawful activists in the spotlight. (For a detailed look at the case: “The World Takes? How corporations and politicians turned animal rights activists into terrorists.”) The SHAC 7 is a landmark First Amendment case that will test how far the government can push “terrorism” rhetoric in order to pursue a political agenda and silence speech.. The case was heard before the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and it is now pending before the Supreme Court of the United States. The activists were convicted under the Animal Enterprise Protection Act.  The law has since been expanded into the Animal Enterprise Terrorism  Act. Here are some recent articles about the SHAC 7: Jurist, the legal news service, discusses why the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act is unconstitutional. Guest commentary by Will Potter. In 2011, we saw two clear, sweeping trends regarding protest movements, and the corporate backlash against them. Before we get to that, though, take a look at the 10 most popular stories of 2011: 10) Tim DeChristopher Sentenced — What’s Next for the Environmental Movement? 9) New Lawsuit Challenges the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act as Unconstitutional 8) Supreme Court […] A new lawsuit challenges the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act as unconstitutional because it has given activists reason to fear that they could be prosecuted as “terrorists” for non-violent civil disobedience, protests, and First Amendment activity. The lawsuit was filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights on behalf of 5 longtime animal rights activists. The activists […] While I was on book tour, I stopped by the studio of KEXP in Seattle for “Mind Over Matters.” KEXP created a video of the interview, which focused on the specific tactics that corporations and industry groups have used to create the idea of “eco-terrorism.

The excerpt takes place on the day of the SHAC 7 arrests, and also looks at the campaigns against Consort Beagle Breeders, Shamrock Farms, and the rise of Stop Huntington Animal Cruelty. You can download the excerpt here (1M, .pdf). But […] The Supreme Court announced today that it will not review the case of the SHAC 7, a landmark First Amendment case in which a group of animal rights activists were convicted as “terrorists” for running a controversial website. The campaign of the SHAC 7 didn’t involve anthrax, pipe bombs, or a plot to hijack an […] The Counter-Terrorism Unit tracks environmental and animal rights prisoners as “domestic terrorists,” alongside dangerous criminals. If animal rights activists are terrorists for running a website listing “targets,” then Tea Partiers and Sarah Palin must be labeled terrorists as well.  An appellate court has refused to revisit the SHAC 7 case, and the lead prosecutor has compared animal rights activists to the Crips and Islamic “jihad.” Tea Party groups and right-wing militias have been plotting attacks on Muslims, throwing bricks through lawmakers’ windows, and issuing death threats, yet the mainstream press and the federal government have not labeled these acts “terrorism.” By contrast, the “number one domestic terrorism threat,” according to the FBI, is the animal rights and environmental movements.

 Part 1 of a two-part series Reports about what life is like inside the military prison for terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay are not uncommon. But very little is reported about two secretive units for convicted terrorists and other inmates who get 24-hour surveillance, right here in the U.S. For the first time, an NPR investigation has identified 86 of the more than 100 men who have lived in the special units that some people are calling "Guantanamo North." The Communications Management Units in Terre Haute, Ind., and Marion, Ill., are mostly filled with Muslims. About two-thirds of the inmates identified by NPR are U.S. citizens. Civil rights groups have filed lawsuits that accuse the U.S. facilities of some of the same due process complaints raised by people at the island prison. Who Belongs In The Prison Units? Avon Twitty, 56, knows a lot about these Communications Management Units, or CMUs. He spent three years in one. These days, he lives in a house with chipped white paint, next to a highway in Washington, D.C. This is the first time he has talked about his experience. 
                Avon Twitty spent several years in the Communications Management Unit in Terre Haute, Ind. He was recently released and is part of a lawsuit challenging the legality of the special prison units.

 Avon Twitty spent several years in the Communications Management Unit in Terre Haute, Ind. He was recently released and is part of a lawsuit challenging the legality of the special prison units. Twitty spent 27 years in prison for shooting a man dead after a neighborhood argument in the 1980s. Years before that, he converted to Islam. He has never been convicted of a terrorist offense. But prison officials sent him to one of the special units in Terre Haute to finish out the remaining few years of his sentence. Twitty says he never found out why. He has a piece of paper saying he allegedly took part in "radicalizing" people, but the transfer document doesn't explain who, or why. Twitty reads from one of the many letters he wrote to prison leaders, asking for answers. "So my question was, what government agency labeled me a terrorist?" Twitty asks. "... What terrorist offense did I commit against the American government or any American citizen? What evidence demonstrated my guilt? Why was I not afforded my constitutional right to a due process hearing?" Inside The Special Units Prison officials opened the first CMU with no public notice four years ago, something inmates say they had no right to do under the federal law known as the Administrative Procedures Act.

 The special unit in Terre Haute contains 50 cells housing some of the people  the U.S. describes as the country's biggest security threats, including John Walker Lindh. He was picked up on the battlefield in Afghanistan, after fighting on the side of the Taliban. Prison officials have never released the names of inmates in Terre Haute or in a companion unit in Marion. But an NPR investigation found out who some of them are. The units' population has included men convicted in well-known post-Sept. 11 cases, as well as defendants from the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the 1999 "millennium" plot to bomb the Los Angeles airport, and hijacking cases in 1976, 1985 and 1996. Also under surveillance in the CMUs are men who have threatened officials from behind bars, ordered murders using contraband cell phones, or engaged in other communications that officials want to monitor. Some of the prisoners inside the Communications Management Units that NPR identified include those from high-profile terrorism cases. Here are several reports on those cases: The population also includes several black Muslims who have been disciplined for alleged radicalization and recruitment while incarcerated for other crimes. When the Terre   Haute unit opened in December 2006, 15 of the first 17 inmates were Muslim. In August 2008, 38 prisoners signed up for Ramadan observances. As word got out that the special units were disproportionately Muslim, civil rights lawyers say, the Bureau of Prisons started moving in non-Muslims. The group included tax resisters, a member of the Japanese Red Army and inmates from Colombia and Mexico. Inmates say the guards there called them "balancers." The Bureau of Prisons says a total of 71 men now live in the units. Segregation Allegations Alexis Agathocleous, a lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights, has a hunch about how the population came to be. "We were concerned about what appears to be racial profiling and also a pattern of designations to the CMUs of people who have spoken out at other prison units and advocated for their rights and have taken leadership positions in religious communities in those other prisons," he says.

 They are segregated from other prisoners because officials worry that they could recruit other inmates for terrorism or direct people in the outside world to commit crimes. American University law professor Stephen Vladeck reviewed NPR's findings. He says he has some questions about the secrecy surrounding the units and whether the prison is sending the right people there. "I think the real question is, what are the constraints and how are we sure that the right people are being placed in these units and not the wrong ones?" Vladeck says. "Mixing prisoners from different backgrounds who actually don't necessarily live up to those criteria I think is troubling," Vladeck adds, because it means some inmates might not belong there, and others who do belong may not be getting the attention they deserve. NPR found two reports, marked "law enforcement sensitive," from 2009. In them, intelligence analysts for the Bureau of Prisons describe religious tension among different Muslim groups in the special units, including at least one violent episode involving a man described as an enforcer. In those units, people convicted of international terrorism mingle with more conventional criminals. So Omar Mohammed Ali Rezaq, who hijacked an EgyptAir flight with other members of a Palestinian terrorist group in 1985, lives in the CMU along with Muslims who were convicted in U.S. government sting operations but who didn't have the resources to carry out a plot on their own. Eavesdropping And Restrictions Guards and cameras watch the CMU inmates' every move. Every word they speak is picked up by a counterterrorism team that eavesdrops from West Virginia. Prison officials budgeted more than $14 million for the snooping operation last year, according to appropriations documents and congressional testimony. Restrictions on visiting time and phone calls in the special units are tougher than in most maximum security prisons. Inmates who lived in the CMUs and their spouses talked to NPR about them for the first time. Hedaya Jayyousi's husband, Kifah, served in the U.S. Navy. He also taught engineering. Then he was convicted of supporting groups in Bosnia and Chechnya that the U.S. government says are tied to terrorism. Kifah Jayyousi has lived in both CMUs. Mrs. Jayyousi now looks after their five children. Unlike most other prison inmates, the people in the CMUs are not allowed so-called contact visits, where they can touch their families. They get fewer hours of visiting time and fewer phone privileges, too. "What happens is we really get very stressful because the way the visit [is] set," Hedaya Jayyousi says,  "we need to hold the phone in our hands, very thick glasses. You can't hear him. [The girls] can't touch him." A History Of Lawsuits For the past year, Twitty and other inmates have been suing the Federal Bureau of Prisons. They say the special units were set up outside the law and raise serious due process issues. Unlike prisoners who are convicted of serious crimes and sent to a federal supermax facility, CMU inmates have no way to review the evidence that sent them there or to challenge that evidence to get out. Twitty says he actually spent months longer in prison than he had to because of his designation to the special CMU unit. The halfway house in Washington wouldn't accept him for several months. 
                Avon Twitty's file folders contain his paper trail of grievances over the years while inside the Communications Management Unit at Terre Haute.

 Avon Twitty's file folders contain his paper trail of grievances over the years while inside the Communications Management Unit at Terre Haute. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., is considering whether to let the prisoners go forward with the lawsuit. Agathocleous, from the Center for Constitutional Rights, is representing the CMU inmates in their ongoing civil rights case (Aref, et al. v. Holder, et al.). He says he's noticed something about his clients: "There is a tenfold over-representation of Muslim prisoners at the CMUs," he says. "So 6  percent of the national prison population is Muslim, and somewhere in the neighborhood of between 66 and 72 percent of prisoners at the CMUs are Muslim." Harley Lappin, who leads the Bureau of Prisons, described the special units to Congress in 2009. "You've got a second tier where we don't have to have them as restricted, but we want to control their communications," Lappin told members of the U.S. House of Representatives. "They are housed in Communications Management Units where we can target, again, communication, both written and verbal, and oversee visits more adequately than in our general population facilities." The unit at Terre Haute includes open cells, an outdoor basketball court and a dining room with checkerboards painted on some of the tables, according to Ken Falk, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union in Indiana. He is one of the few people to see inside the unit at Terre Haute and is representing several inmates in a lawsuit (Arnaout et al. v. Warden) that alleges that the Communications Management Unit violates their religious rights. He says Muslim inmates are allowed to do all kinds of things together, except pray. That, he says, is breaking a law known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The law requires the federal government to follow the least burdensome approach when it comes to peoples' religious faith and practice. "The problem from our perspective in the CMU is that the prisoners are out anyway and they're allowed to engage in all sorts of activity, and they're not allowed to engage in group prayer," Falk says. "In fact, prisoners have been punished when two prisoners have gone back to their cells together to pray." Ed Ross, a spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons, didn't want to comment on the court cases. He says the special units help make sure inmates are monitored at all times. The units are designed for people convicted of terrorism, prisoners who have dealt drugs or tried to recruit or radicalize others behind bars; and prisoners who have abused their communications privileges by harassing victims, judges and prosecutors, Ross says. Terrorism experts say all those restrictions in the special units might minimize radicalization inside U.S. prisons. The Justice Department inspector general and some members of Congress say that has been a big problem in the past. NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor

In a 10 week clinical study published in the Journal of International Society of Sports Nutrition, with sedentary men and women, the group who drank one  CELSIUS per day experienced Significantly Better Results. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Celsius Holdings, Inc. was founded in 2004. CELSIUS was introduced in a glass bottle in June 2005 with the flavors cola, lemon-lime and ginger ale. CELSIUS launched in a 12oz sleek can and the popular flavors, Orange and Wild Berry, were added to the line-up. Soon after, the refreshing non-carbonated flavors, Raspberry Açaí and Peach Mango, as well as the CELSIUS On-the-Go powdered sticks, were available at retail. Five additional university studies were completed on CELSIUS’ proprietary formula, validating its benefits of burning body fat and its ability to burn a minimum of 100 calories per can. CELSIUS garnered over 16 international awards for health, taste and innovation.  The additional flavors of Watermelon and Grape launched and the brand underwent a strategic study to re-brand and position away from a “diet” item to that of a trend forward lifestyle brand, finding its niche in what is best described as a “Fitness Drink”.  Consistency in packaging and positioning around the globe began to take shape. CELSIUS’ new positioning as a Fitness Drink was met with market-wide acceptance.  The brand won the InnoBev “Best Functional Drink” award at the Frankfurt, Germany, gala, among 180 entrants world wide.  The new re-brand took hold as the graphics on the original packaging were refreshed for single serve cans, 4pks and powders. The CELSIUS sweetened with Stevia line extension launched in the first quarter with three sparkling and three non-carbonated flavors.  The line is naturally caffeinated and sweetened and intended for sale in the natural channel, a segment of the industry which CELSIUS had yet to be placed. The company launched a second product in the portfolio, CELSIUS HEAT.  The new product includes the same proprietary formula, but has an increased caffeine level (300mg) and added L-Citrulline.  It launched with three carbonated flavors and with a focus on the fitness, military and vitamin specialty channels of trade.  The CELSIUS HEAT line is the second product in the CELH portfolio.    †CELSIUS alone does not produce weight loss in the absence of a healthy diet and moderate exercise.

These days there are often more things on our To-Do list than can get done.  If you have ever had more work than hours in a day, that “planned” gym time may be slipping away. Rather than trying to fit in a workout before running off to work or trying to be active after work when your energy may be low, why not lose weight during your lunch break?! New research suggests that even a 30 minute walk during your lunch break may boost your mood, as well as increase your ability to manage stress and nerves in the office. If walking isn’t your thing and you want a bit more of a challenge, you have to try the “deskercise” 30 minute workout routine listed below! Not only will you get your training in, but you will feel even more energized as you get back into the workplace. The best part- these moves require little to no equipment and most can be done in the comfort of your office work-space! Try this routine 3 days per week and you can leave work each day feeling productive and active! ***Tip: Leave a pair or workout clothes/shoes in a spare drawer at work or in your car so that if you have the opportunity to sneak in a quick workout, there are NO excuses! Lose Weight During Your Lunch Break- Power Moves Lunch Break Workout Description Office Desk Dips– Face away from a sturdy desk and place the palm of both hands on the edge. Walk your feet out about 2 feet in front of you and begin to support your weight on your palms. Tighten your core and then begin to drop your glutes to the floor. Once your arms are at or near a 90 degree angle, push up through your palms to the start position. For an advanced movement, bring one leg up off of the ground and use only one leg to support and stabilize. Switch the supporting leg half way through the repetitions. Lunge Back with a Kick– Begin standing with both feet together. Balance weight on to your left foot and then push your right foot and leg back into a lunge position. Allow for your front knee to bend to a 90 degree angle and then push back up through the ball of your right foot and follow all the way through with a kick. Repeat on the left leg for all 10 repetitions and then switch to the right side. For an advanced move you can bring both hands overhead. This will work on stability and balance. Office Desk Push-Ups– Face towards a sturdy desk and place both palms on the edge. Walk your feet back about 2 feet until you are in a plank position. Keep you back flat and core tight through the movement. Begin by slowly lowering your chest down towards the edge of the desk. Then push back up through the palms of your hands. For an advanced movement, hold one leg up and balance weight on the opposite foot. Switch the balancing foot mid-way. Wall Squats– Stand with your back flat against a wall and then walk your feet forward and slide down into your start position which should look like you are sitting in a chair. Hold this position for 20 seconds to begin. Then stand up and relax for a few seconds and repeat 2 more times for a total of 60 seconds. For an advanced movement, hold the wall squat for 1 minute with arms elevated over head or alternate balancing from one foot to the other. Stair Climbers– Most office buildings have flights of stairs that are begging to be used! Hold on to the rails if needed for extra balance. Single steps for 2 flights Skip a step for 2 flights Single steps with a leg kick back and squeeze your glutes for 2 flights Single steps for 2 flights Turn around and briskly walk back down to the bottom as a recovery. Repeat this 2 more times or until you reach 5 minutes total. For an advanced stair climb, you can triple the workout duration and try to avoid pulling yourself up with the handrails. This entire “deskercise” workout can be completed in 30 minutes flat! What are some of your favorite ways to clear your mind and get moving during your lunch break? Share them in the comments section below! 
Did you go overboard a bit this holiday weekend? If you did, no worries, you are not alone. Between the get togethers and Pumpkin Pie, many of us have fallen off track with our fitness goals. But today is a new day and and NEW MONTH. So here are a few tips to get you feeling great while burning those extra calories off in no time!
Get Back to Your Normal Routine
You may be exhausted from the weekend, but make it a priority to get back to your normal eating and exercise routine. Pack your meals for work so you aren’t tempted to snack on some left over pies and goodies at the office. The longer you stay off track, the harder it will be to get back in the swing of things.
Chuck the Sugary Sweets and Left Overs
It may be hard to part ways with the Pecan Pie and Bread Rolls, but they aren’t doing your waistline any favors. Some of these holiday treats have over 20g of carbs/sugar per serving, meaning you are easily creeping up on your recommended sugar limit for the day. If it is not pies but stuffing and gravy that make your heart sing – look out! Those extra nibbles of leftovers will ADD UP quickly! So either give it away or get it out.
Drink Protein
Get back on track by adding extra protein to your diet. The ISO 100 from Dymatize helps crush cravings with all of its delicious flavors. More than 20g of protein per scoop- which means you will feel full while having a delicious and waist line friendly snack. Get Moving!
Does the extra food have you feeling sluggish? The last thing you want to do after over-indulging is sit around. Here is an at-home workout that will torch fat and burn tons of calories in only 15 minutes. (Be sure to warm up before getting started.)
After Turkey Day Fitness Routine
Duration: 5 rounds with 45 second rests between rounds
• 20 jumping jacks
• 20 high knees
• 20 squats
• 10 forward lunges per leg
• 20 per leg mountain climbers
Be sure to really push yourself and complete as many repetitions as possible at your own pace.
Other Options:
• Walking your dog for 30 minutes at a brisk pace.
• Jogging in place or doing standing alternating knees to chest in your living room during commercial breaks of your favorite shows.
• Anything to get up and get the heart rate flowing.
These simple steps will have you burning off the feast in no time. So get over the guilt and get moving! Would love to hear from you! In the comments section below, please share your tips to get through the holidays while staying on track. With the overwhelming amount of social media that we are bombarded with daily, it can be easy to feel like we are not doing “enough”.  You don’t have thousands of followers, aren’t being paid to promote some teeth whitening non sense or poop tea, aren’t sponsored by your favorite brand, you drive a 10 year old car, are renting an apartment, can’t seem to stay in a relationship if you life depended on it. Yet you see the girls with “perfect” bods, hundreds of thousands/millions of followers. They take lavish vacations, drive the nicest cars and seem like they have it ALL while having it ALL together. I like to remind people that social media for most, is a personal highlight reel. Make-Up is perfect #Selfie, outfit on point #OOOTD, sponsorship #blessed, won something #everybodymustknow. m u s t. d o c u m e n t. e v e r y t h i n g. . . And there is NOTHING wrong with that because the internet provides us with an open forum to post AS WE WISH. So I’m not here to shy you away from posting your highlights, rather I am here to tell you that when you scroll through your feeds and feel down or like your life is not so glamorous and fab, that you need to SNAP out of it and  focus on yourself instead of all of the things that everyone else is doing or posting. Think the grass is greener on the other side? Well the grass is greener where you water it…  What does that mean? Well we all have our own plot of land (if you will), and the way that we care for our land determines what is growing and how green it is. If you are so busy admiring your neighbors plot of grass… how will you have the opportunity to tend and grow your own??? Makes sense when you think about it right…? Here is another thing I want you to think about. There are some people that you may look up to and admire for their “accomplishments”, but in some cases you do not know what it took for them to get to that position. They may have had to “sell their soul” and the glitz and glamour may simply be what you see on screen. Believe it or not, some people keep their personal lives “personal”, so you never know if they are having issues with their children, work, they are sick, in debt….. the list goes on. So STOP comparing and START water your own grass, would ya?!  Here are some tips that help me out if I am ever feeling down or like I am not “enough”… Power Off Avoid spending too much time on social media, the hours you spend swiping up could be spent working towards your own greener grass. Count Your Blessings Think of all the blessings you have. Probably a computer or smart phone if you are reading this. A home, clean clothes, a friend you can count on, some sort of income… the list goes on. When you think of someone who lacks those things we take for granted, it puts things into perspective. Get Better Not Bitter See something that someone is doing that you wish you were doing? Then get BETTER not bitter. Ask that person for some advice on how to get started in that field, or make the proper steps to get you there. Sitting on the sideline and wishing will not get you any where. That I can guarantee. So I hope this post is a sign that it is time to get up and GO! Stop waiting for tomorrow- start NOW. Your homework (yes) is to write down 3 goals that you personally want to accomplish. Having these goals in writing will help you to focus on yourself rather than wallowing in self pity over the things you wish you had or were doing. Make your own dreams come TRUE.

I am a personal fan of any of the Quest bars that contain “chunks”- so the chocolate chip cookie dough (yum), white chocolate raspberry (nomnom) are among my faves. I actually eat the chunks and leave the rest of the bar to the birds- LOL!!! Anyway enough on my bizarre eating habits… the pumpkin pie bars. Quest released them at the end of September 2015 and I just HAD to get my hands on them. Rumor had it they were unlike any bar before- dun dun duuuuuuuun. (For those who have never had a Quest bar-They are a gluten free, low net carb, high fiber protein bar. They have about a dozen flavors and you are bound to find one you like.) Thanks to Jarrod and Annelise from Southern Muscle Sport Nutrition, I got a whole box- Wahhhooooo! Let the reviewing begin…  So on first appearance I was a bit shocked because the bar was actually coated, imagine when something is yogurt covered. It was a bright orange with rough mounds on top. I would later find out that those mounds were delicious crunchy goodness. The bar itself is just like any of the other plain quest bars. The overall flavor and texture were pretty good but they don’t compare to my bars with the chunks- all time favorite!!! The best way to eat one in my opinion is 10-15 seconds in the microwave… warm and soft goodness. The macros on these are a bit higher than the other flavor options I believe and I think it has something to do with the outer coating. Serving: 1 Bar, Calories: 220, Fat: 12g, Carbs: 19g (4 Net), Protein: 21g SO what are your thoughts? Would you try it? Or have you already? Leave me a comment and let me know what you thought about it! #GetPumpkin When I received a call from Robin Chang, the promoter of the Olympia event, I about fell out of my chair. While I never publicly put it out there, a big goal of mine this year was to qualify for the 2015 Bikini Olympia. After having a successful 2015 season, I did decide to sit out the last few shows of the year since I knew my body was needing a bit of a break. During this time I was just hoping I would have enough points to qualify for the 2015 Olympia… and I did! During my “time off” acted as if I was going to the Olympia WEEKS before I even knew so that I would have enough time to prepare in case I was given the opportunity. But once I got that call- it was GO TIME! Below are a few clips from my training before hitting the BIG stage! I train 5-6 days a week and eat 5-6 meals a day. This is typical for me, but you have to understand that THIS is a huge part of my life and passion. Even on days when I don’t have much motivation, getting into the gym and doing something is better than nothing 🙂 Looking back on this experience is just a true feeling of bliss. I have a lot of people on my side and I am so thankful!!! Thank you to my sponsors- Celsius- Bluefish Sport- ZenBody Foods- Bombshell Fitness- IFBB/NPC- Pro Tan- CJ’s Elite Suits- Glam Competition Jewelry. I appreciate you all following along on my journey- Let me know if you have any questions!!!  There are some days I LOOOOOVE cooking and other days that make me want to flail on the floor like a child and never deal with a stove again…. I digress…. However on either occasion I have a few secret weapons that I just HAVE to share with you. 1. Crock Pot– DO IT! Buy one. I didn’t for the longest time because I thought they were for grannies and the lunch lady. WRONG!!!!! Crock pots are GENIUS!!! I love throwing flank steak or chicken in there for about 6 hours on low. It comes out perfect, juicy and SUPER tender. To jazz it up, you can add in some diced onion,peppers and tomatoes and it will come out more like a stew. Add with a side of rice (or throw the rice in after a few hours and it is a perfect dish that will last for DAYS)…. you are welcome! 2. Crock Pot Liners– Crock pots make amazing meals BUT the clean up SUCKS!!! The juices get all stuck on the sides and takes a lifetime to scrub off untiiiiiiiil crock pot liners. LIFE savers! A 4 pack runs about $2.50- cannot beat it for time saving and zero frustration.  3. Salt Free Mrs. Dash Seasonings– Welcome to my freaking fiesta baby! I add salt to my meals before I eat it, in case I am adding a sauce or condiment so that it is not sodium overload or if cooking for someone else. But sometimes during prep for competitions or events I kick it with these Salt Free options so that I am not gagging on cold bland cod while contemplating the meaning of life (tell us how you really feel). Legit Mrs. Dash- SO good! I don’t have time to figure out which seasonings make my shrimp taste like a fajita, but Momma Dash did and I thank her for it. I hope you check these tips out- they help me and save TONS of time! Any one use these or have any fun tips to share? Comment below. PS.I post up more healthy living tips on my IG and it gets pretty weird over there- so follow me @angelesburke – DO IT!!! OK- let’s face it. The marketing world has gone above and beyond to make us feel that the sugar free, low fat, low carb, low sodium buzz words make a product healthy. And THAT my friends could not be further from the truth. Seriously- next time you are in the store, I want you to READ the BACK of the box- not just the catchy bold words printed on the front. What is on the back is what REALLY counts. Added sugars, preservative and unpronounceable ingredients run rampant on the nutrition labels. In this video I give you some of the shopping tips I use each week to see if what I am buying for myself and loved one is really all that it is cracked up to be- enjoy! Be sure to head over to my site http://www.angelesburke.com and sign up for my free healthy living tips 🙂 Cable rows are a great exercise for your back, biceps and shoulder muscles. Using different grip attachments on the machine can help you target different muscles in your back. I personally prefer doing the seated rows with one arm. This allows me to concentrate on working each side evenly. As I fatigue while doing double handed rows, my dominant side tends to over compensate. Doing single or one arm rows allows me to effectively build my back. Begin with a warm up set of about 15 repetitions. Then choose a more challenging weight. Be sure to let your back do the majority of the work. If you are using too much momentum then you are recruiting secondary muscles and not training as effective. Control the weight at all times. Below is a video demonstrating this effective move. 4 sets of 12-15 repetitions per side. 20 second rest between sets. Let’s GO!

Most of us can read. And what we read in the #MuellerReport is vastly different than your misleading representations.

Schumer and pelosi call for mueller to testify publicly.pic.twitter.com/HyElaDIlIv Attorney General Barr’s partisan behavior has triggered a crisis of independence & impartiality. This is astonishing. He’s Trump’s defense attorney. Thanks for the help, Mr. Attorney General, but I think I’ll decide for myself (as will my fellow citizens) what “the bottom line” is after reading the report, rather than taking instruction ahead of time from a political operative. Robert Mueller didn't conduct that investigation for you, Mr. Barr. He conducted it for the American people. You're supposed to work for us too. Start acting like it. Rod Rosenstein’s face is everything. My only question is who will play him on SNL. https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10216472757543956&id=1007584935 … Cathy Tauber hey!

This nonprofit honors Giraffe Heroes—compassionate risk-takers who are largely unknown, people who have the courage to stick their necks out for the common good, in the US and around the world. When we tell their stories over social and traditional media, others are moved to stick their necks out too, helping solve significant public problems important to them. Our books, blogs, curricula, speeches and trainings help them succeed. As long as there are Giraffe Heroes , there's hope. Telling the series of heroes may be the oldest strategy in the world for motivating people into brave, compassionate action—and it works. We offer you here— Here's a short video of Giraffe Heroes' stories to give you a taste of the power of the inspiration they provide—inspiration the Giraffe Heroes Project has been sending across the world since 1984, You believe in real heroes, right? Like the ones who inspired YOU? So keep us going so we can inspire (and offer training) to thousands more people, sending them  into action on the public problems that test our times.

The Project meets all 20 of the BBB's strict Standards for Charity Accountability. Guidestar is another solid gold reference.  This is Sister Megan Rice, a nun for most of her 80+ years and a peace  activist since the 1980s. She had been arrested more than three dozen  times and had done time twice when she and two other peace activists  performed what was called the most serious security breach in the  history of US nuclear facilities.

Andy Hall, a Brit, works for Finnwatch, a world-wide nonprofit that      spots human abuses around the  world and works to stop them. When Hall  called out Thailand's National  Fruit Company for the way it treats its  workers, he asked to work with them on improving their operations. The  company needed to stop using child labor, taking away foreign workers'  passports, and ignoring Thai laws that give workers paid sick days and  leave. The...  This is Catherine Hamlin MD, who left her home in Australia in 1959 to  provide gynecological care to poor women in Ethiopia. At 90, she's still doing that, focusing on one of the most distressing medical/social  issues imaginable: obstetric fistulas.  This is an injury that  women can suffer if they have no medical assistance at a difficult  childbirth. If you don't know about it, that's because it probably  doesn't happen where you live. But it happens a lot in Ethiopia, leaving...  This is Hanna Hopko. She braved snipers' bullets in Kiev during a  citizens' uprising that brought down a corrupt government there. Now  she's leading a rapidly growing citizens' movement that's doing more  than rising up and demanding change--they're writing new legislation  that makes government open, just and democratic, then pressing  legislators to pass these new laws. Her car's been destroyed and her  life threatened but Hopko has led...  Imagine you're 11 years old and your body is twisting from  scoliosis, causing you constant physical pain and making you look very  different from other kids. You're scheduled for surgery to straighten  your spine and your mom takes a "before" picture so you'll have a  history of how you once looked. But instead of hiding the picture away  in a drawer, you decide to put it online so people will understand what  scoliosis does, and so that others who are dealing with it might be less tempted...  Bob Bajek, a reporter on a  small-town newspaper in Illinois, came up with a Big Story: the town's  recreational lake, where residents fished, swam, and boated, was highly  toxic--a now defunct military base had dumped Agent Orange in the water. He also found that the area's air had been polluted; the town had  burned some buildings on the base that were full of asbestos. OK, then  there's the ground water--dangerous chemicals used on the...  There were no protections for whistle-blowers in South Africa when  businesswoman Wendy Addison reported her own corporate bosses for  breaking the law.  She was fired, got death threats, and was  blacklisted, even in England, where she took her young son, hoping to  re-start her career.  She now writes and speaks about the vital role  whistle-blowers play in making sure institutions don't break laws or  endanger public health and safety.  This is veteran environmental activist, Xiuhtezcatl Roske-Martinez. He's 12. And he's been working to save his beloved Colorado for half of his life. It started when he saw that the forest near his home was  changing. Trees were dying, plants and animals were disappearing, and  the fires were getting larger, happening more often. The six-year-old  took the microphone at a public gathering and started telling people  what he was seeing,...  Allan Adam is Chief of the Athabasca Chipewyan nation, whose lands lie  within Alberta, Canada. These First Nation people have formal treaty  rights that protect their lands from being taken or used by outsiders,  but that treaty has been repeatedly broken by one abuse after another.  Now it's oil companies, who want to extract tar sands. Allan Adam is  fighting day and night, in the courts and in the media, to protect his  people's health,...  Sangduen Chailert, known as  "Lek," puts in 18-hour days caring  for sick and injured elephants in a protected reserve she co-founded,  the Elephant Nature Park in northern Thailand.  The dwindling elephant population is a world-wide concern and Chailert is in the thick of saving them in her country. Doing so has endangered her own safety: She campaigns against  "crushing," the stabbing,  beating, and starving that handlers do in...

Welcome to the website that is perhaps my Letter to the World, which has indeed written back, once in a while, despite my late start on the correspondence. My real work began when I was more than half-way through what's turning out to be a long life. Now, actuarially, time is getting short. So I'm gathering up as many bread crumbs as I can find of that late-begun work and leaving them here, in the vast forest that is the internet, in hopes they may be of value on your path to a long and creative life. There's a lot here. Do wander. Welcome to it all. Site content © 2016, Ann Medlock. All rights reserved.

All strawberries, all the time. Swedish sliced pepparkakor made with 100% wholegrain rye flour.  A challenge to think deeper about how food, race, gender and class are interconnected.  What gender norms do we perpetuate in food media and how do we change? Using food as a vehicle for acknowledging the truth about Thanksgiving.  A desk calendars that turns into a series of postcards when each month is over. A cozy recipe for fall with a combination of typical Scandinavian flavors. Put Comestible: Issue 6 on your autumn reading list. Ferment your own ginger pickles for a spicy condiment.  A classic cake to celebrate Swedish midsummer.  Foodie Underground // Anna Brones 2014. All Rights Reserved.






 The rules for living well, if you can call them that, are simple and a pleasure to follow. Eat local and mostly plants. Ride your bike, even on rainy days. Say yes to dinner invitations. Always bring your signature dessert. Invite people on picnics. Bike in the sunshine. Follow a morning ride with a strong French press. – The Culinary Cyclist The first cookbook of its kind, The Culinary Cyclist is a gorgeous staple for any kitchen where bicycling and healthy, delicious food are priorities.  Concocted by Anna Brones and lovingly illustrated by Johanna Kindvall, this cookbook is your guide to hedonistic two-wheeled living. Recipes are all gluten free and mostly vegan and include such decadent basics as Sea Salt Chocolate Cake and baked eggs in avocado halves (it may just be the perfect breakfast) are paired with cheerful instructions for gracefully hosting a dinner party, gifting food, bulk shopping by bicycle, and two-wheeled picnics.   This cookbook is suitable for experienced cooks looking to add kitchen flair to their repertoire as well as beginners in the kitchen who want to start out their culinary lives on the right foot. This may be the first cookbook out there that assumes its readers use a bicycle to do everything from grocery shop to picnic to bring an unforgettable cake, in one piece, to a dinner party. Check out the Foodie Underground shop to get your copy today! We sell them on their own, and in 3- and 5-packs! Foodie Underground // Anna Brones 2014. All Rights Reserved.
