Justice Department seeking subpoena interview president Heâ saying instance Mueller stopped moving forward something wanted michael barbaro matter moment much second question obstruction justice come presidentâ motivation essentially matter getting someoneâ head never hearing President Trump feel significant maggie haberman Itâ huge deal Barr lay letter Congress Muellerâ thinking describes report set evidence side question think presidentâ lawyer repeatedly offered explanation president could something necessarily nefarious undermining main thing said isnâ obstruction itâ playing public Itâ hidden right express view citizen country anticipate ever see report going show lot michael schmidt Maggie would talk Rudy Giuliani investigation â michael barbaro presidentâ lawyer michael schmidt

presidentâ motivation essentially matter getting someoneâ head never hearing President Trump feel significant maggie haberman Itâ huge deal Barr lay letter Congress Muellerâ thinking describes report

Taibbi sort left wing critic medium upset locus really bad reporting MSNBC much reporting even sort coverage like kind people Rachel Maddow night night analyze sense itâ understandable people left skeptical would find particularly upsetting MSNBC supposed obviously left center channel think worst think problem mainstream press sort narrative omission Itâ people specifically getting thing wrong time although lot case know McClatchy report supposedly confirming Cohen gone Prague story sort hung single outlet never confirmed general sort tenor issue would ton reporting low level Trump campaign aidesâ connection Russian official lot le reporting time went Steele dossier looked bogus right would sort broader press critique thing werenâ panning le coverage say know Michael Flynn talking Russian ambassador david leonhardt would say letâ see Mueller report think thereâ chance although individual story like McClatchy story appear wrong think thereâ good chance much beat reporting going look quite solid end wait see Okay letâ talk whatâ going happen next Michelle see House Democrats going want go michelle goldberg Iâ quite sure think go actually feel like weâ seeing far look like something cover Barr trying spin one way already sort seized narrative really want Democrats set record straight Iâ glad given April 2nd deadline show report think need agitate much possible get report know feel like line going forward â exonerates hiding â think itâ extremely important Intelligence Committee intimidated pursuing counterintelligence implication know time Democratic candidate never really wanted talk stuff like political perspective seems make sense sort know let Judiciary Committee job let intelligence committee job know kind take gift wrapped present Trumpâ Justice Department gave u signaled wanted Supreme Court overturn entire Affordable Care Act know kind start running many depredation Trump inflicting country david leonhardt struck contrast mean idea Trump administration kicked headline coverage Barrâ summary Mueller report try take away health insurance people found remarkable bit political malpractice Ross assume agree idea Democrats essentially trying focus pocketbook issue running Trump president hasnâ improved peopleâ life much better tactic Democrats scandal mongering way might actually worst week Democratic Party ross douthat totally agree bad week Republican hoping would primary challenge Donald Trump sort remove one obvious way Trump could sort fall apart politically Heâ much le likely fall apart politically much le likely face strong challenger therefore somewhat stronger election way Democrats successfully attacked Trump successfully attack Trump still think health care example mean think conservative policy people legal people think challenge little bit ridiculous itâ case Trump something seems sort purely partisan doesnâ even much intellectual heft behind itâ also â unpopular thing Trump done area trying repeal replace Obamacare extent push u towards health care conversation away Russia conversation elected Democrats may happy happened david leonhardt Letâ end talking 2020 candidate Ross called attention interesting piece written Tyler Cowen economist arguing Mueller report might affect Joe Bidenâ candidacy tell listener ross douthat Iâ sure agree Cowen smart guy basically argues Biden selling presumably sort custodial candidate kind return normalcy candidate know adviser even talking one term pledge idea older politician often think floating heâ sort embodiment know kind Washington establishment always upset Trump kind norm violator possible Putin catâ paw way could argue weakens candidacy know want get Trump think Putin running foreign policy getting Biden make sense itâ ultimately election domestic policy domestic priority think Democrats maybe case make strongest argument Biden maybe look little weaker david leonhardt Michelle get last word think end Mueller investigation affect Democrats 2020 michelle goldberg mean say Ross said â like know Iâ really upset week dream Trump led White House handcuff died although know would spectacular life affirming thing know whatâ upsetting said know Republicans feel gleeful emboldened think people sort lying job opposing Ross presented true silver lining turn event Right help end rationale Joe Bidenâ candidacy even begin almost say worth david leonhardt note end segment Weâ right back Two last three president elected despite losing popular vote Trumpâ case lost lot living era minority rule Michelle written last week Senator Elizabeth Warren called end electoral college senator elizabeth warren Get rid electoral college CHEERS david leonhardt call ignited long simmering debate Ross get go first discussion Tell u hate democracy love Electoral College ross douthat Well segment know full self righteousness totally totally convinced argument making one going little different Iâ strong devout believer Electoral College think itâ obviously kind jerry rigged system doesnâ exactly original designer intended certainly isnâ would design system scratch time sort scale liberal certainty getting rid inspires mount least partial defense guess Iâ make couple point first itâ hardly abnormal political system deliver various form minority rule Itâ quite common parliamentary system end minority prime minister minority government way get U unique know American distinctive kind way itâ hardly unknown developed world minority government end elected one reason â counterintuitive point â donâ think itâ actually worst thing system basically tell get 50 1 percent vote arenâ actually guaranteed winning way guarantee victory getting 53 54 55 percent vote think kind system incentivizes party polarized politics creates incentive kind politics weâ increasingly country think historically thatâ itâ worked havenâ come current era polarization keep outcome think long run canâ get Electoral College become pathway constitutional crisis think historically itâ actually worked interesting way critic think michelle goldberg mean Electoral College intolerable given u two minority president within short period time many many decade idea somebody winning presidency despite losing popular vote treated sort like outrÃ hypothetical could possibly happen know nobody living ever seen itâ reality itâ reality Trump could win election despite losing popular vote even certain point majority country belief government intolerable nothing nothing system creates outcome mean itâ recipe regime crisis sort feel like know country weâ little bit younger vigorous would regime crisis already ross douthat mean Iâ making kind absolutist argument think get outcome like 2016 2000 ultimately lead regime crisis also think talk polarization polarization weâ experiencing distinctive somewhat unique thing American history Electoral College around 200 year therefore hundred year data usually work argument historically happens brief period ideological regional polarization might say College creates incentive party try get quickly say Democrats right looking situation could win popular vote still lose Trump theory create incentive Democrats work harder get towards Reaganesque Rooseveltian majority country actually need escape cycle polarization david leonhardt want talk one defense drive nut idea say get rid electoral college youâ saying rural people donâ matter Whereas youâ saying Americans treated equally Iâ saying people Wyoming Alaska Vermont matter le people Texas California Iâ saying matter equally guess Ross Iâ curious partial defender Electoral College serious version argument Iâ missing donâ get ross douthat Well think version argument agree itâ good system mean distinctive minority political minority find political leverage without get 51 52 percent vote national election donâ think system 51 percent always win 49 percent always lose perfect legitimacy 51 percent bigger 49 percent think thatâ actually defense Senate Electoral College would defend Senate ground think itâ good create leverage point regional rural population end neglected think portion American population Midwest Greater Appalachia neglected last 20 year think Senate effectively Electoral College kind leverage would survive even move popular vote want ask guy though design perfect system question isnâ whether get rid Electoral College right itâ replaces elect president david leonhardt guess comfortable national popular vote understand risk sort massive national recount nightmarish think itâ worth taking seriously Iâ open sort proportional state based system get lot closer popular vote really think downside Electoral College absolutely swamp downside national popular vote system ross douthat itâ national popular vote without runoff david leonhardt mean weâ talked Iâ big fan idea ranked choice voting donâ think would runoff Iâ perfectly comfortable idea vote rank candidate ranked third party candidate first go vote next michelle goldberg Yeah agree Thatâ mean honest havenâ given huge amount thought mean basically think get rid Electoral College national popular vote mechanism vote something thought lot know Iâ big fan like David ranked choice voting congressional election state election Like Maine adopted think state adopt canâ think argument using national level ross douthat Well mean Iâ wildly idea think every idea come creates potential downside One thing Electoral College definitely make hard third party challenger really challenge presidency unless sort concentrated regional support Like Ross Perot last really successful third party candidate really didnâ get electoral vote michelle goldberg Wait Ross like third party ross douthat Iâ â Iâ playing around little bit Right donâ think would terrible would create situation someone like Howard Schultz neither guy particularly like right incentive get help make Donald Trump president maybe would Electoral College system mean itâ â Green Bookâ problem last get make Oscar analogy right â Green Bookâ best picture despite think general agreement kind mediocre movie nobody really hated people ranked pretty high ranked choice voting probably least one maybe many movie got number one vote best picture still lost â Green Book â ranked choice system delivers inoffensive president people dislike least potentially denying nomination someone maybe get actual vote maybe thatâ fine change michelle goldberg K thatâ worth thinking actually find â Green Bookâ possibility scary persuasive still sound better system sort â mehâ candidate chance winning candidate virulently hated majority population ross douthat Yeah mean think whatâ definitely true Electoral College supposed create impediment basically demagogue Right michelle goldberg Right â electoral college supposed stop people like Trump respect itâ obviously failed ross douthat Yes Electoral College sense also make sense system stronger political party longer think Trump fact could win despite Electoral College show itâ one job founder envisioned time think Hillary Clinton deserved lose last election campaigned canâ help feeling Trumpâ election also make kind case Electoral College strange way david leonhardt one exciting thing getting rid Electoral College would place wholly ignored presidential campaign longer would mean colleague Jamelle Bouie pointed inland California place huge number conservative voter almost totally ignored presidential campaign would longer big city Texas lot Democratic voter would basically take people whoâ left process involve thatâ idea excites ross douthat mean guess argument make sense living era sort massive political disengagement nobodyâ voting voter turnout falling doesnâ seem overall kind era weâ necessarily living right Like feel like case constitutional amendment make sure get slightly higher turnout rural California decisive case way regime crisis case seems much stronger case david leonhardt mean yes Voter turnout rate among people age 30 40 pretty horrifically low 25 year old living inland empire California living Dallas said vote doesnâ matter thereâ way theyâ right idea making people feel like responsive political system inherent value could actually happen whole bunch state including California New York passed law saying devote Electoral College vote winner popular vote long enough state fact count weâ two third way toward actually happen Republican lose winning popular vote Republican state pas legislation think weâ actually closer Electoral

sort founder fact Russiagate controversy actually led u war Russia happily whereas W controversy lead u actual mostly disastrous war think comparison useful think see itâ useful way Michelle made argument know turned really werenâ W Iraq Saddam Hussein actually masterminding conspiracy Al Qaeda people supported Iraq War would fall back say â Well look K werenâ WMD Saddam wasnâ bed Al Qaeda horrible dictator gassed people source regional instability still kind reason removed power Iraq War good idea â fine still case huge amount medium coverage political argument pinning huge amount

version sort compromised manipulated even version heâ compromised manipulated nothing Barr letter rule part compromised manipulated necessarily crime would part counter intelligence part probe still know basically nothing final thing want say really reminds Iraq War belligerence among pro war proponent sort like concentrated onslaught kind information onslaught although pre social medium kind knocked balance Right Particularly youâ liberal youâ sort person always assumes truth elusive people might point remember know 20 feeling discombobulated right Like maybe people sure right thatâ campaign reminds like relentless like â going apologize â know thatâ feel like ross douthat mean guess know â canâ resolve perfectly want say course youâ right completely possible material actual Mueller report make Barr letter look like lawyered document concealed reality said think itâ generally unlikely Robert Mueller know whatâ report known Barr long time shown perfect willingness correct record various point past would sort willingly let played way weâ see weâ find next week actual report come michelle goldberg Right think happening think could happening heâ letting played like doesnâ think truth ever going come Trump administration getting head start sort setting term debate early theyâ muddying water way people arenâ going kind able make sense come next Right Barr werenâ political hack long experienced covering Republican scandal hadnâ chosen exactly reason imagine headline story Mueller didnâ establish crime related coordination conspiracy find significant evidence crime obstruction evidence know kind keeping precedent special counsel turned Congress evaluated Right Instead sort stepped point kind convince anybody close follower administration Barr capable absolving president point kind create confusing headline give talking point david leonhardt mean clearly weâ trying think overall feel someone consumed lot medium would gotten yes think understand disagree Michelle think know far suggests outcome Mueller investigation going le people would thought hand donâ think case look back reporting done people actually trying report â people New York Times Washington Post lot place â arenâ lot story got wrong think lot interpretation Ross disagree mean isnâ like W look back say wow story really look wrong ross douthat mean think reason folk like Taibbi sort left wing critic medium upset locus really bad reporting MSNBC much reporting even sort coverage like kind people Rachel Maddow night night analyze sense itâ understandable people left skeptical would find particularly upsetting MSNBC supposed obviously left center channel think worst think problem mainstream press sort narrative omission Itâ people specifically getting thing wrong time although lot case know McClatchy report supposedly confirming Cohen gone Prague story sort hung single outlet never confirmed general sort tenor issue would ton reporting low level Trump campaign aidesâ connection Russian official lot le reporting time went Steele dossier looked bogus right would sort broader press critique thing werenâ panning le coverage say know Michael Flynn talking Russian ambassador david leonhardt would say letâ see Mueller report think thereâ chance although individual story like McClatchy story appear wrong think thereâ good chance much beat reporting going look quite solid end wait see Okay letâ talk whatâ going happen next Michelle see House Democrats going want go michelle goldberg Iâ quite sure think go actually feel like weâ seeing far look like something cover Barr trying spin one way already sort seized narrative really want Democrats set record straight Iâ glad given April 2nd deadline show report think need agitate much possible get report know feel like line going forward â exonerates hiding â think itâ extremely important Intelligence Committee intimidated pursuing counterintelligence implication know time Democratic candidate never really wanted talk stuff like political perspective seems make sense sort know let Judiciary Committee job let intelligence committee job know kind take gift wrapped present Trumpâ Justice Department gave u signaled wanted Supreme Court overturn entire Affordable Care Act know kind start running many depredation Trump inflicting country david leonhardt struck contrast mean idea Trump administration kicked headline coverage Barrâ summary Mueller report try take away health insurance people found remarkable bit political malpractice Ross assume agree idea Democrats essentially trying focus pocketbook issue running Trump president hasnâ improved peopleâ life much better tactic Democrats scandal mongering way might actually worst week Democratic Party ross douthat totally agree bad week Republican hoping would primary challenge Donald Trump sort remove one obvious way Trump could sort fall apart politically Heâ much le likely fall apart politically much le likely face strong challenger therefore somewhat stronger election way Democrats successfully attacked Trump successfully attack Trump still think health care example mean think conservative policy people legal people think challenge little bit ridiculous itâ case Trump something seems sort purely partisan doesnâ even much intellectual heft behind itâ also â unpopular thing Trump done area trying repeal replace Obamacare extent push u towards health care conversation away Russia conversation elected Democrats may happy happened david leonhardt Letâ end talking 2020 candidate Ross called attention interesting piece written Tyler Cowen economist arguing Mueller report might affect Joe Bidenâ candidacy tell listener ross douthat Iâ sure agree Cowen smart guy basically argues Biden selling presumably sort custodial candidate kind return normalcy candidate know adviser even talking one term pledge idea older politician often think floating heâ sort embodiment know kind Washington establishment always upset Trump kind norm violator possible Putin catâ paw way could argue weakens candidacy know want get Trump think Putin running foreign policy getting Biden make sense itâ ultimately election domestic policy domestic priority think Democrats maybe case make strongest argument Biden maybe look little weaker david leonhardt Michelle get last word think end Mueller investigation affect Democrats 2020 michelle goldberg mean say Ross said â like know Iâ really upset week dream Trump led White House handcuff died although know would spectacular life affirming thing know whatâ upsetting said know Republicans feel gleeful emboldened think people sort lying job opposing Ross presented true silver lining turn event Right help end rationale Joe Bidenâ candidacy even begin almost say worth david leonhardt note end segment Weâ right back Two last three president elected despite losing popular vote Trumpâ case lost lot living era minority rule Michelle written last week Senator Elizabeth Warren called end electoral college senator elizabeth warren Get rid electoral college CHEERS david leonhardt call ignited long simmering debate Ross get go first discussion Tell u hate democracy love Electoral College ross douthat Well segment know full self righteousness totally totally convinced argument making one going little different Iâ strong devout believer Electoral College think itâ obviously kind jerry rigged system doesnâ exactly original designer intended certainly isnâ would design system scratch time sort scale liberal certainty getting rid inspires mount least partial defense guess Iâ make couple point first itâ hardly abnormal political system deliver various form minority rule Itâ quite common parliamentary system end minority prime minister minority government way get U unique know American distinctive kind way itâ hardly unknown developed world minority government end elected one reason â counterintuitive point â donâ think itâ actually worst thing system basically tell get 50 1 percent vote arenâ actually guaranteed winning way guarantee victory getting 53 54 55 percent vote think kind system incentivizes party polarized politics creates incentive kind politics weâ increasingly country think historically thatâ itâ worked havenâ come current era polarization keep outcome think long run canâ get Electoral College become pathway constitutional crisis think historically itâ actually worked interesting way critic think michelle goldberg mean Electoral College intolerable given u two minority president within short period time many many decade idea somebody winning presidency despite losing popular vote treated sort like outrÃ hypothetical could possibly happen know nobody living ever seen itâ reality itâ reality Trump could win election despite losing popular vote even certain point majority country belief government intolerable nothing nothing system creates outcome mean itâ recipe regime crisis sort feel like know country weâ little bit younger vigorous would regime crisis already ross douthat mean Iâ making kind absolutist argument think get outcome like 2016 2000 ultimately lead regime crisis also think talk polarization polarization weâ experiencing distinctive somewhat unique thing American history Electoral College around 200 year therefore hundred year data usually work argument historically happens brief period ideological regional polarization might say College creates incentive party try get quickly say Democrats right looking situation could win popular vote still lose Trump theory create incentive Democrats work harder get towards Reaganesque Rooseveltian majority country actually need escape cycle polarization david leonhardt want talk one defense drive nut idea say get rid electoral college youâ saying rural people donâ matter Whereas youâ saying Americans treated equally Iâ saying people Wyoming Alaska Vermont matter le people Texas California Iâ saying matter equally guess Ross Iâ curious partial defender Electoral College serious version argument Iâ missing donâ get ross douthat Well think version argument agree itâ good system mean distinctive minority political minority find political leverage without get 51 52 percent vote national election donâ think system 51 percent always win 49 percent always lose perfect legitimacy 51 percent bigger 49 percent think thatâ actually defense Senate Electoral College would defend Senate ground think itâ good create leverage point regional rural population end neglected think portion American population Midwest Greater Appalachia neglected last 20 year think Senate effectively Electoral College kind leverage would survive even move popular vote want ask guy though design perfect system question isnâ whether get rid Electoral College right itâ replaces elect president david leonhardt guess comfortable national popular vote understand risk sort massive national recount nightmarish think itâ worth taking seriously Iâ open sort proportional state based system get lot closer popular vote really think downside Electoral College absolutely swamp downside national popular vote system ross douthat itâ national popular vote without runoff david leonhardt mean weâ talked Iâ big fan idea ranked choice voting donâ think would runoff Iâ perfectly comfortable idea vote rank candidate ranked third party candidate first go vote next michelle goldberg Yeah agree Thatâ mean honest havenâ given huge amount thought mean basically think get rid Electoral College national popular vote mechanism vote something thought lot know Iâ big fan like David ranked choice voting congressional election state election Like Maine adopted think state adopt canâ think argument using national level ross douthat Well mean Iâ wildly idea think every idea come creates potential downside One thing Electoral College definitely make hard third party challenger really challenge presidency unless sort concentrated regional support Like Ross Perot last really successful third party candidate really didnâ get electoral vote michelle goldberg Wait Ross like third party ross douthat Iâ â Iâ playing around little bit Right donâ think would terrible would create situation someone like Howard Schultz neither guy particularly like right incentive get help make Donald Trump president maybe would Electoral College system mean itâ â Green Bookâ problem last get make Oscar analogy right â Green Bookâ best picture despite think general agreement kind mediocre movie nobody really hated people ranked pretty high ranked choice voting probably least one maybe many movie got number one vote best picture still lost â Green Book â ranked choice system delivers inoffensive president people dislike least potentially denying nomination someone maybe get actual vote maybe thatâ fine change michelle goldberg K thatâ worth thinking actually find â Green Bookâ possibility scary persuasive still sound better system sort â mehâ candidate chance winning candidate virulently hated majority population ross douthat Yeah mean think whatâ definitely true Electoral College supposed create impediment basically demagogue Right michelle goldberg Right â electoral college supposed stop people like Trump respect itâ obviously failed ross douthat Yes Electoral College sense also make sense system stronger political party longer think Trump fact could win despite Electoral College show itâ one job founder envisioned time think Hillary Clinton deserved lose last election campaigned canâ help feeling Trumpâ election also make kind case Electoral College strange way david leonhardt one exciting thing getting rid Electoral College would place wholly ignored presidential campaign longer would mean colleague Jamelle Bouie pointed inland California place huge number conservative voter almost totally ignored presidential campaign would longer big city Texas lot Democratic voter would basically take people whoâ left process involve thatâ idea excites ross douthat mean guess argument make sense living era sort massive political disengagement nobodyâ voting voter turnout falling doesnâ seem overall kind era weâ necessarily living right Like feel like case constitutional amendment make sure get slightly higher turnout rural California decisive case way regime crisis case seems much stronger case david leonhardt mean yes Voter turnout rate among people age 30 40 pretty horrifically low 25 year old living inland empire California living Dallas said vote doesnâ matter thereâ way theyâ right idea making people feel like responsive political system inherent value could actually happen whole bunch state including California New York passed law saying devote Electoral College vote winner popular vote long enough state fact count weâ two third way toward actually happen Republican lose winning popular vote Republican state pas legislation think weâ actually closer Electoral College functionally mattering lot people realize itâ good time dig upside downside Electoral College discussion Weâ right back weekly recommendation itâ time weekly recommendation give suggestion

Maggie maggie haberman Hi michael schmidt hear maggie haberman Yes hear michael schmidt Yeah hold hold hold Wearing two headphone right maggie haberman Mm Sounds right michael schmidt hear Oh thatâ better maggie haberman gotcha Weâ waiting star michael barbaro Hi maggie haberman Itâ Michael Barbaro host â Daily â michael schmidt Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo michael barbaro New York Times Iâ Michael Barbaro â Daily â Today â Attorney General William Barr sent letter Congress summarizing finding special counsel investigation coordination Russia complicated obstruction justice colleague Maggie Haberman Mike Schmidt explain Itâ Monday March 25 K Maggie like 6 00 p Sunday evening Two hour ago attorney general Bill Barr sent letter congressional leader outlining major conclusion special counselâ report michael schmidt report broken two part first one biggest central question surrounded president since elected tie campaign Russia issue Barr unequivocal michael barbaro say michael schmidt say tie Russia election Trumpâ campaign despite aggressively Russians tried interfere election even outreach made campaign able find evidence actually worked together michael barbaro Mike help understand lead report Mueller investigation issued number subpoena charge felt like revealed form collusion Iâ thinking Papadopoulos Manafort meeting inside Trump Tower involved presidentâ son son law felt like form collusion michael schmidt think went Trump campaign sort collusion curious sense open sort talking anyone anything Russians reaching right meant lot odd contact occurred think Mueller Barr saying even though lot stuff look funky evidence linked hand tried work together hurt Clinton michael barbaro collusion curious equal coordination maggie haberman interested getting information something heard either president say people around president say know course took meeting course people reached u listened wouldnâ argument anyone would argument theyâ made repeatedly discombobulated green new even know collude someone covered campaign tell logic argument michael barbaro somebody whoâ slightly removed day day investigation either itâ starting feel summary Bill Barr Mueller report investigation found kind knew investigation found finding nothing big held back help u understand conclusion maggie haberman saw indictment either Paul Manafort deputy Rick Gates pleaded guilty Mike Flynn George Papadopoulos might seems information able prove existed michael barbaro Mike think michael schmidt Letâ go back look indictment guilty plea George Papadopoulos campaign official contact individual said Russians going releasing information Hillary Clintonâ email came George Papadopoulos pleads guilty plead guilty conspiring Russians pleads guilty making false statement investigator contact presidentâ former national security adviser Michael Flynn odd phone call Russian ambassador transition discus lifting sanction imposed Obama administration election meddling Mike Flynn go court plead guilty doesnâ plead guilty conspiring Russians pleads guilty making false statement F B went along investigation past 22 month never saw charge said campaign conspired Russia question â Mueller holding something like end going wait make move Well today know never found anything michael barbaro Right wasnâ making kind indictment didnâ evidence maggie haberman least didnâ enough bring indictment mean might found strain information might found piece along way clearly enough bring charge michael barbaro end bunch people around president lying perhaps avoid might look like coordination going tell truth actually coordinating according legal definition michael schmidt Correct michael barbaro second question letter question obstruction justice Barrâ summary Mueller report say michael schmidt obstruction part nearly clean cut collusion section obstruction Barr essentially say Mueller come determination whether president obstructed justice Mueller could indict exonerate president charge left door open Barr say look Mueller made determination attorney general along deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein make call believe case made president obstructed justice michael barbaro donâ quite understand whatâ going think Mike Mueller declined weigh question obstruction justice leave kind air maggie haberman Thereâ really full explanation Iâ sure past 22 month Democrats lot folk medium built Mueller sort paragon justice someone willing able go make determination call really tough issue non partisan follow fact way Mueller essentially saying donâ really determination relevant action letter say investigated report set evidence side question leaf unresolved special counsel view quote â difficult issue law fact concerning whether presidentâ action intent could viewed obstruction â special counsel state quote â report conclude president committed crime also exonerate â michael barbaro Letâ pick apart think agree salient example maybe disentangling motive law obstruction justice really tangled would firing James Comey president first say itâ Russia go television say really Russia yet know president pretty much fire anyone level want Bill Barr summarizing Mueller saying stuff really difficult weâ making call maggie haberman Mueller saying really difficult itâ hard get presidentâ head know intent frame mind decides going one make call Bill Barr wanting think leave open ended thing put pin say done michael barbaro say make call maggie haberman make call believe sufficient say president obstructed justice remember obstruction justice key Richard Nixon piece presidentâ folk worried felt really confident whole time would evidence based case conspiracy related Russia concerned would find obstruction piece michael schmidt Interestingly â still donâ think issue gotten enough attention â central question presidentâ intent took action like firing Comey end day president United States never sat interview investigator answer question attorney general saying thing done weâ never heard Donald Trump reason never heard Donald Trump lawyer afraid sat answer question would make factually inaccurate statement would increase criminal exposure michael barbaro itâ within presidentâ right sit interview michael schmidt Thatâ true Justice Department could subpoenaed interview michael barbaro didnâ michael schmidt One unanswered question investigation central question presidentâ intent Bob Mueller never able ask question michael barbaro wasnâ able ask question never issued subpoena never pursued legal avenue maggie haberman donâ know whether pursued legal avenue told wasnâ sufficient anything go get subpoena whether didnâ seek one right sit open question donâ know whether Bob Mueller actually sought go subpoena lot people thought would Weâ going know time michael schmidt learn Friday Barr first announced end Mueller investigation instance investigation Mueller wanted take major step like indict someone subpoena get search warrant told superior Justice Department could would sort bolster argument Mueller stopped Justice Department seeking subpoena interview president Heâ saying instance Mueller stopped moving forward something wanted michael barbaro matter moment much second question obstruction justice come presidentâ motivation essentially matter getting someoneâ head never hearing President Trump feel significant maggie haberman Itâ huge deal Barr lay letter Congress Muellerâ thinking describes report set evidence side question think presidentâ lawyer repeatedly offered explanation president could something necessarily nefarious undermining main thing said isnâ obstruction itâ playing public Itâ hidden right express view citizen country anticipate ever see report going show lot michael schmidt Maggie would talk Rudy Giuliani investigation â michael barbaro presidentâ lawyer michael schmidt would say thing like obstruction justice trying interfere investigation going dark alley threatening break someoneâ leg cooperate investigator Itâ bribing someone testify Giuliani said stuff happening open Heâ trying twist anyoneâ arm Heâ blowing steam investigation conspiracy michael barbaro either surprised either action outlined letter come obstruction justice â Mueller declining make call Barr quick make call maggie haberman surprised Mueller didnâ make call surprised Barr moved quickly think collusion aspect letter going revelatory think obstruction one possibly would shuts definitively piece letter havenâ talked Bill Barr attorney general tell Congress Robert Mueller special counsel recognized quote â evidence establish president involved underlying crime related Russian election interference determinative absence evidence bear upon presidentâ intent respect obstruction â big piece thinking Barr seems since underlying crime found related president obstruction harder prove michael barbaro word connection two question coordination obstruction justice coordination original sin itâ hard establish obstruction justice maggie haberman Right crime committed hard suggest president trying obstruct justice course pursuing evidence crime argument Mike also heard presidentâ lawyer say repeatedly couldnâ obstruction justice thereâ nothing obstruct michael barbaro seem like universally sound legal logic canâ commit crime obstructing investigation something wasnâ crime certainly feel like someoneâ investigating decide stop investigation violation law could violation law separate apart whether investigated first place crime mean two thing necessarily connected michael schmidt think thereâ two reason Justice Department would want bring case like first thereâ underlying crime really want bring obstruction case really want go court try convince jury someone took action nothing cover think thatâ tough case make second thing president huffed puffed lot investigation Iâ sure much real damage Bob Mueller able pursue inquiry fired finished werenâ impeded Justice Department real damage president obstructing really hurt investigation Give damage report donâ think end day much actually hurt Muellerâ teamâ ability job may loud may annoying may dispiriting think able pursue needed maggie haberman think also thereâ third point think Bob Mueller mindful dealing presidency damage ongoing case like iffy locked solid completely nailed could cause office presidency kind trauma brings country michael barbaro Iâ struck weâ talking Maggie Mike least according letter exactly front u along maggie haberman Unless report lot information weâ seeing saw play publicly attorney general made clear investigation ending without recommendation indictment includes sealed indictment weâ getting move Capitol Hill Democrats seek get much material term part president really concerned term Mueller michael barbaro letâ talk Congress going Congressional leader received letter Mike told u past Democrats going cautious proceeded circumstance Mueller didnâ find sort thing would force even Republicans Congress acknowledge president violated law impeachment proceeding would unlikely seems like letter Democrats would needed move forward sort way michael schmidt think take lot wind sail basically full blown investigation obstruction collusion going Mueller someone far better tool ever investigate coming clearing president Russia issue giving mixed message obstruction allows Barr clear give Republicans good argument say guy continuing look issue continuing rummage around presidentâ life weâ received clarity Justice Department think hurt maggie haberman think youâ going see Nancy Pelosi Democratic House speaker proceed carefully late evening Sunday still said anything going handle think going see lot Republicans reminding Democrats holding Robert Mueller avatar credibility investigation going hard say need know need make determination couldnâ almost inevitably look political michael schmidt Democrats going ask everything Mueller report itâ clear letter lot obstruction justice issue looked detailed analyzed question Democrats get hand damaging obstruction stuff strong enough give Democrats oomph obstruction investigation michael barbaro understanding Congress get full copy Mueller report examine answer maggie haberman donâ think thatâ resolved yet michael schmidt Thatâ big question michael barbaro Maggie month president calling Mueller investigation witch hunt worse would better lean description turn around say know investigation gold star investigation say Iâ clear maggie haberman lot people White House encouraging president turn say highly respected prosecutor said collusion hope accept move try strike healing note presidentâ political instinct burrow base say witch hunt hoax heard number adviser say publicly last hour Itâ son said statement gave think going go full telling people waste two year effort undo electoral result 2016 donâ let happen michael barbaro wonder explain listener wasnâ said president might call â waste two year waste everyoneâ time effort politically undermine maggie haberman might effect undermining might one impact know based numerous assessment intelligence community Russians seek interfere 2016 election know many contact Russians people involved Trump campaign trying find heart one would think waste time answer world president could say gave clean bill health trust going forward michael barbaro Mike want ask question explanation investigation waste time michael schmidt Well legitimate issue question answered along way president took action action made perception something wrong worse fired F B director asked F B director end investigation whether former national security adviser talking improperly Russian ambassador said thing publicly investigation time time demonize investigator criticized attorney general recused Russia investigation called Muellerâ team bunch angry Democrats made perception worse thing walked line obstruction looked sorted Whether clear president say hey look nothing wrong sake give public confidence president United States Russian agent michael barbaro among question answered investigation Russian interference election regardless answer presidentâ role happens answer seemingly nothing illegal answer unearthed michael schmidt significant portion country thought president United States either wittingly unwittingly worked foreign adversary influence election something looked michael barbaro didnâ Bill Barr also belief obstruct investigation michael schmidt nothing obstruct maggie haberman least thatâ found michael barbaro one asked â maggie haberman Michael think michael barbaro think Russia could never fathomed cosmically disruptive effort influence election

Manafort meeting inside Trump Tower involved presidentâ son son law felt like form collusion michael schmidt think went Trump campaign sort collusion curious sense open sort talking anyone anything Russians reaching right meant lot odd contact occurred think Mueller Barr saying even though lot stuff look funky evidence linked hand tried work together hurt Clinton michael barbaro collusion curious equal coordination maggie haberman interested getting information something heard either president say people around president say know course took meeting course people reached u listened wouldnâ argument anyone would argument theyâ made repeatedly discombobulated green new even know collude someone covered campaign tell logic argument michael barbaro somebody whoâ slightly removed day day investigation either itâ starting feel summary Bill Barr Mueller report investigation found kind knew investigation found finding nothing big held back help u understand conclusion maggie haberman saw indictment either Paul Manafort deputy Rick Gates pleaded guilty Mike Flynn George Papadopoulos might seems information able prove existed michael barbaro Mike think michael schmidt Letâ go back look indictment guilty plea George Papadopoulos campaign official contact individual said Russians going releasing information Hillary Clintonâ email came George Papadopoulos pleads guilty plead

lifting sanction imposed Obama administration election meddling Mike Flynn go court plead guilty doesnâ plead guilty conspiring Russians pleads guilty making false statement F B went along investigation past 22 month never saw charge said campaign conspired Russia question â Mueller holding something like end going wait make move Well today know never found anything michael barbaro Right wasnâ making kind indictment didnâ evidence maggie haberman least didnâ enough bring indictment mean might found strain information might found piece along way clearly enough bring charge michael barbaro end bunch people around president lying perhaps avoid might look like coordination going tell truth actually coordinating according legal definition michael schmidt Correct michael barbaro second question letter question obstruction justice Barrâ summary Mueller report say michael schmidt obstruction part nearly clean cut collusion section obstruction Barr essentially say Mueller come determination whether president obstructed justice Mueller could indict exonerate president charge left door open Barr say look Mueller made determination attorney general along deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein make call believe case made president obstructed justice michael barbaro donâ quite understand whatâ going think Mike Mueller declined weigh question obstruction justice leave kind air maggie haberman Thereâ really full explanation Iâ sure past 22 month Democrats lot folk medium built Mueller sort paragon justice someone willing able go make determination call really tough issue non partisan follow fact way Mueller essentially saying donâ really determination relevant action letter say investigated report set evidence side question leaf unresolved special counsel view quote â difficult issue law fact concerning whether presidentâ action intent could viewed obstruction â special counsel state quote â report conclude president committed crime also exonerate â michael barbaro Letâ pick apart think agree salient example maybe disentangling motive law obstruction justice really tangled would firing James Comey president first say itâ Russia go television say really Russia yet know president pretty much fire anyone level want Bill Barr summarizing Mueller saying stuff really difficult weâ making call maggie haberman Mueller saying really difficult itâ hard get presidentâ head know intent frame mind decides going one make call Bill Barr wanting think leave open ended thing put pin say done michael barbaro say make call maggie haberman make call believe sufficient say president obstructed justice remember obstruction justice key Richard Nixon piece presidentâ folk worried felt really confident whole time would evidence based case conspiracy related Russia concerned would find obstruction piece michael schmidt Interestingly â still donâ think issue gotten enough attention â central question presidentâ intent took action like firing Comey end day president United States never sat interview investigator answer question attorney general saying thing done weâ never heard Donald Trump reason never heard Donald Trump lawyer afraid sat answer question would make factually inaccurate statement would increase criminal exposure michael barbaro itâ within presidentâ right sit interview michael schmidt Thatâ true Justice Department could subpoenaed interview michael barbaro didnâ michael schmidt One unanswered question investigation central question presidentâ intent Bob Mueller never able ask question michael barbaro wasnâ able ask question never issued subpoena never pursued legal avenue maggie haberman donâ know whether pursued legal avenue told wasnâ sufficient anything go get subpoena whether didnâ seek one right sit open question donâ know whether Bob Mueller actually sought go subpoena lot people thought would Weâ going know time michael schmidt learn Friday Barr first announced end Mueller investigation instance investigation Mueller wanted take major step like indict someone subpoena get search warrant told superior Justice Department could would sort bolster argument Mueller stopped Justice Department seeking subpoena interview president Heâ saying instance Mueller stopped moving forward something wanted michael barbaro matter moment much second question obstruction justice come presidentâ motivation essentially matter getting someoneâ head never hearing President Trump feel significant maggie haberman Itâ huge deal Barr lay letter Congress Muellerâ thinking describes report set evidence side question think presidentâ lawyer repeatedly offered explanation president could something necessarily nefarious undermining main thing said isnâ obstruction itâ playing public Itâ hidden right express view citizen country anticipate ever see report going show lot michael schmidt Maggie would talk Rudy Giuliani investigation â michael barbaro presidentâ lawyer michael schmidt would say thing like obstruction justice trying interfere investigation going dark alley threatening break someoneâ leg cooperate investigator Itâ bribing someone testify Giuliani said stuff happening open Heâ trying twist anyoneâ arm Heâ blowing steam investigation conspiracy michael barbaro either surprised either action outlined letter come obstruction justice â Mueller declining make call Barr quick make call maggie haberman surprised Mueller didnâ make call surprised Barr moved quickly think collusion aspect letter going revelatory think obstruction one possibly would shuts definitively piece letter havenâ talked Bill Barr attorney general tell Congress Robert Mueller special counsel recognized quote â evidence establish president involved underlying crime related Russian election interference determinative absence evidence bear upon presidentâ intent respect obstruction â big piece thinking Barr seems since underlying crime found related president obstruction harder prove michael barbaro word connection two question coordination obstruction justice coordination original sin itâ hard establish obstruction justice maggie haberman Right crime committed hard suggest president trying obstruct justice course pursuing evidence crime argument Mike also heard presidentâ lawyer say repeatedly couldnâ obstruction justice thereâ nothing obstruct michael barbaro seem like universally sound legal logic canâ commit crime obstructing investigation something wasnâ crime certainly feel like someoneâ investigating decide stop investigation violation law could violation law separate apart whether investigated first place crime mean two thing necessarily connected michael schmidt think thereâ two reason Justice Department would want bring case like first thereâ underlying crime really want bring obstruction case really want go court try convince jury someone took action nothing cover think thatâ tough case make second thing president huffed puffed lot investigation Iâ sure much real damage Bob Mueller able pursue inquiry fired finished werenâ impeded Justice Department real damage president obstructing really hurt investigation Give damage report donâ think end day much actually hurt Muellerâ teamâ ability job may loud may annoying may dispiriting think able pursue needed maggie haberman think also thereâ third point think Bob Mueller mindful dealing presidency damage ongoing case like iffy locked solid completely nailed could cause office presidency kind trauma brings country michael barbaro Iâ struck weâ talking Maggie Mike least according letter exactly front u along maggie haberman Unless report lot information weâ seeing saw play publicly attorney general made clear investigation ending without recommendation indictment includes sealed indictment weâ getting move Capitol Hill Democrats seek get much material term part president really concerned term Mueller michael barbaro letâ talk Congress going Congressional leader received letter Mike told u past Democrats going cautious proceeded circumstance Mueller didnâ find sort thing would force even Republicans Congress acknowledge president violated law impeachment proceeding would unlikely seems like letter Democrats would needed move forward sort way michael schmidt think take lot wind sail basically full blown investigation obstruction collusion going Mueller someone far better tool ever investigate coming clearing president Russia issue giving mixed message obstruction allows Barr clear give Republicans good argument say guy continuing look issue continuing rummage around presidentâ life weâ received clarity Justice Department think hurt maggie haberman think youâ going see Nancy Pelosi Democratic House speaker proceed carefully late evening Sunday still said anything going handle think going see lot Republicans reminding Democrats holding Robert Mueller avatar credibility investigation going hard say need know need make determination couldnâ almost inevitably look political michael schmidt Democrats going ask everything Mueller report itâ clear letter lot obstruction justice issue looked detailed analyzed question Democrats get hand damaging obstruction stuff strong enough give Democrats oomph obstruction investigation michael barbaro understanding Congress get full copy Mueller report examine answer maggie haberman donâ think thatâ resolved yet michael
