supremacy movement right think itâ growing think itâ always sort small meaningful way itâ getting attention right jamelle bouie think itâ le kind ever present part American society Itâ hard look given period American history kind organized movement white supremacist specifically like virulent violent white supremacist time even explicit state sanction think remember depending time American history movement kind different relationship society second Ku Klux Klan late 1910s 1920s exists le bolster mainstream idea Americanism predominance kind white Anglo Saxon America current iteration taking kind autonomous cell model â 80 â 90 show â Timothy McVeigh Oklahoma City bomber part â leaderless resistanceâ term use â kind super charging ross douthat mean Jamelle know conservative politics overlap peopleâ populist politics turn overlap people sort scarily close fringe view seems thereâ big shift mostly internet sort outside event driven last five six year think one way look really well illustrated horrifying New Zealand case kind globalization European anxiety youâ large trend towards immigration cultural conflict around Islam Europe going year decade sort brought sharp point Syrian refugee crisis rise ISIS wave ISIS inspired bombing turn created kind white identitarian theory world found acolyte North America way Australia New Zealand sort took piece European experience normative state global whiteness became inspiration case violence time think itâ connected might call kind crisis white Christian church western world lot child grow seem like failing culturally irrelevant form Christianity often end sort contempt Christianity donâ turn left turn sort racial identity michelle goldberg nihilistic troll culture seems like one way thereâ politician far know anywhere earth effectively bridge 8chan shit posting European replacement theory Right Thatâ Donald Trump itâ necessarily think Donald Trump inspired movement think success right fact youâ going give life service act horrific mass violence itâ usually think horrific act mass violence going get closer grandiose goal One thing Donald Trump done made feel like dream slightly le impossible Right basically white supremacist shitposter become president United States maybe dreamed revolution really happen david leonhardt want home Trumpâ role mean itâ really clear Trump play causal role look rise racism anti Semitism social medium Thatâ way read data pretty significant increase different data set theyâ imperfect guess want see whether probably likely Ross disagrees idea â heâ cause fact white nationalist president United States making stuff common jamelle bouie Yeah guess think see term use decent historical analogy see term relationship Andrew Johnson kind anti black vigilante violence immediate post Civil War period Itâ Andrew Johnson caused didnâ give shit right LAUGHS didnâ care much time happened excused felt heard people ground indifference occasional sort like complicity creates atmosphere people willing inflict violence decide maybe get away maybe itâ done send message message get kind amplification powerful political leader think thatâ kind important dynamic Iâ sure would attribute causal mechanism feedback loop happening michelle goldberg piece feel like Trumpâ election convinced people convinced white nationalist much wider support theyâ realized Right mean think terrorist act sense theyâ acting behalf greater silent population poll recently show something like 19 percent people believe Trump opposes white nationalism tell large number supporter believe Trump fact oppose white nationalism feel like youâ willing take kind step believe people behind believe youâ going kind support even sort catalytic effect youâ going spark sort uprising ross douthat think Iâ closer Jamelleâ take Michelleâ think right way understand Trump yeah heâ someone doesnâ give shit white nationalism president United States powerful office lot cultural influence undoubtedly toxic effect culture kind role spreading idea making seem credible think calling Trump white nationalist sort analytic mistake mean weâ discussion count white nationalism think imputes level ideology doesnâ think itâ reasonable call sort bigot racist white nationalist guess Iâ put way think thing would happening without Donald Trump think conversation episode cause much important next 20 year world history Trump isnâ think itâ good right condemn Trump handle stuff enables people donâ think ultimately either extreme people acting general drift driven much idea Donald Trump elected build white ethnostate think dream white ethnostate response much broader dislocation anxiety transformation Trump kind particularly striking epiphenomenon david leonhardt Iâ saying Trump causing really donâ think would Trump hadnâ run campaign mean Trump 30 plus year history racism right Going back ad newspaper Central Park case run office run race conscious racist campaign weâ basically seen adult lifetime along surge racism anti Semitism online graffiti best tell number actual crime Iâ saying heâ main cause donâ think itâ enough say doesnâ care white nationalism would happening hadnâ showed itâ possible go say thing still elected president jamelle bouie mean guess think itâ tough disentangle two Like youâ think one line history Western society 1945 present slow motion collapse race hierarchy least slow motion collapse race hierarchy explicit form lot thing happening reaction look Trump like Ross said epiphenomenon entire career right Like someone whoâ casual bigotry casual racism acted racism kind make curiosity first national life time go becomes part public persona also itâ hard say Trump wasnâ much would happening year actually week Trump announced campaign Dylann Roof killed nine people Charleston Right Sort like kind violence precedes Trump planning Trump feel like Iâ willing say causal relationship like Trumpâ campaign style disregard willingness elevate people kind adjacent world â borrow terminology last decade politics â aid comfort enemy Right Iâ sure itâ causal david leonhardt Letâ end Iâ interested thought quickly think play American public point Trump obviously think still play well mean ran closing week midterm campaign basically running would describe kind white nationalist message much think actually help heading 2020 hurt point Jamelle jamelle bouie Itâ always easier start like baseline view thing baseline view thing Trump could somehow stop talking November 2020 win election Right Like background condition American society good enough people could forget Donald Trump president would win Donald Trumpâ problem cannot stop talking cannot stop reminding people president kind aggressive offensive disheartening way extent language rhetoric remind people thing specifically dislike President Donald Trump hurt cannot help david leonhardt Michelle michelle goldberg know Donald Trump minority president right elected minority coalition election depends sort minority rule United States perpetuation minority rule United States inasmuch thatâ bet heâ made way keep base united think keep giving want president completely embrace racial cultural grievance desire spite enemy became decent man canâ become might expand coalition little bit would lessen intensity ross douthat think Michelle right portion Trumpâ base sort responds comment also sort medium attack comment ending binding tightly general Iâ Jamelle think time sort flirtation white nationalism stuff really helped Trump early Republican primary trying build initial base support Thatâ started birtherism helped become candidate supporter point know economy good different version Trumpism authentically populist economics constantly flirting white nationalism think would much electorally effective donâ think stuff hurt much people read New York Times think hurt donâ think help meaningful way david leonhardt K weâ going

school maybe affirmative action program legacy admission program better world elite school sort purely meritocratic admitted kid 1600s SATs michelle goldberg possible defense legacy admission ross douthat reason school want family sort intergenerational loyalty sort invested school schoolâ success radical argument every society elite itâ bad thing elite sense stewardship continuity legacy admission worst way bring want elite continuity generation generation obviously well outside norm argument democratic society seems might true Iâ curious Jamelle think strange right wing defense affirmative action jamelle bouie like area potential convergence agree real meritocracy American society extent meritocracy kind like transmission act transmit inherited advantage accept kind buy premise meritocracy isnâ necessarily great way distributing resource like access elite college â elite college Iâ going define like youâ Harvard Yale kind like highly selective school overall Remember scandal kid trying get USC david leonhardt think itâ important add public school right mean Jamelle youâ talking u Charlottesville University Virginia University North Carolina Michigan Berkeley theyâ

institution provide education also cultivating elite Iâ Ross Iâ rather something explicit discussion rather submerged bunch pretense Two thing really influence thinking first sociologist Orlando Patterson year ago book â Ordeal Integration â make case affirmative action case affirmative action isnâ merit Itâ simply sufficiently elite organization whatâ going happen people going selecting people similar want institution diverse better reflect country mandate take people look differently second thing big college education scandal happened year Landry College Prep school scandal small

anything succeed true michelle goldberg Right Itâ kind school make succeed jamelle bouie Right exactly thatâ true know letâ drop pretense meritocracy Letâ say Ross suggested weâ kind cultivating elite want elite look like United States term racial diversity regional diversity religious diversity forth go make decision based Versus pretense time think pretense actually quite important American politics past 20 year one think drop somewhat david leonhardt thing donâ completely understand though whatâ logical extension argument youâ making say hey elite school regional diversity Iâ University Texas great system thatâ mostly worked extremely well took originally top 10 percent high school class say racially diverse economically diverse Iâ whole way pick get University Texas University Virginia Harvard youâ done donâ think youâ actually â either Jamelle Ross â suggesting sort lottery slot think want meritocracy part process michelle goldberg Right went like balancing meritocracy

exclusively stupidest heir shipping family right david leonhardt effort effort didnâ go far LAUGHS ross douthat think people overestimate hostile past talent Right course want elite talented say youâ elite school weâ gonna set minimum SAT score pegged average distribution SAT score ethnic group region whatever weâ going ensure weâ admitting people canâ handle work obviously donâ get rid sort bias towards merit assume system right might biased towards merit elite level think thereâ larger conversation Harvard Yale pretended theyâ mass opportunity game theyâ Theyâ tiny elite school meanwhile rest American higher ed pretended theyâ like Harvard Yale fact need state school different approach Catholic school different approach historically black college different approach need much investment community college vocational education definitely shift elite college approach thing would go hand hand shift like know mid level state university handle thing might case like certain kind public university meritocratic know based test know lot different approach michelle goldberg mean one reason sort meritocratic ideal important create illusion fairness around whatâ extremely unfair system underlying kind structural thing massively unequal society insane kind funnel system decide deserves opportunity sort know dignity health decent life Right start kind saying weâ going allocate healthy existence getting school â many case mean kind excelling standardized test â completely deform educational incentive starting pretty far back make stake process kind intolerably high everyone jamelle bouie One thing want add discussion think Virginia attended public school part solution term taking pressure taking weight scramble get sort like ultra elite school addition equal society also society opportunity broadly distributed really succeed major way kind uproot community move major city maybe even completely different state kind make important attain kind credential recognized nationally Harvard degree Yale degree get education Virginia Tech find opportunity Virginia North Carolina thing regional term distribution like elite kind diffuses tension ross douthat mean American system long time national elite narrow elite regional elite could get mean think still especially case South Jamelle correct Iâ wrong sense sort regional school pull South elsewhere coast sort Ivy
