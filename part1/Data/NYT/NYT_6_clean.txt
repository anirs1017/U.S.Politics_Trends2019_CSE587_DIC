kind autonomous cell model ‚ 80 ‚ 90 show ‚ Timothy McVeigh Oklahoma City bomber part ‚ leaderless resistance‚ term use ‚ kind super charging ross douthat mean Jamelle know conservative politics overlap people‚ populist politics turn overlap people sort scarily close fringe view seems there‚ big shift mostly internet sort outside event driven last five six year think one way look really well illustrated horrifying New Zealand case kind globalization European anxiety you‚ large trend towards immigration cultural conflict around Islam Europe going year decade sort brought sharp point Syrian

anywhere earth effectively bridge 8chan shit posting European replacement theory Right That‚ Donald Trump it‚ necessarily think Donald Trump inspired movement think success right fact you‚ going give life service act horrific mass violence it‚ usually think horrific act mass violence going get closer grandiose goal One thing Donald Trump done made feel like dream slightly le impossible Right basically white supremacist shitposter become president United States maybe dreamed revolution really happen david leonhardt want home Trump‚ role mean it‚ really clear Trump play causal role look rise racism anti Semitism social medium That‚ way read data pretty significant increase different data set they‚ imperfect guess want see whether probably likely Ross disagrees idea ‚ he‚ cause fact white nationalist president United States making stuff common jamelle bouie Yeah guess think see term use decent historical analogy see term relationship Andrew Johnson kind anti black vigilante violence immediate post Civil War period It‚ Andrew Johnson caused didn‚ give shit right LAUGHS didn‚ care much time happened excused felt heard people ground indifference occasional sort like complicity creates atmosphere people willing inflict violence decide maybe get away maybe it‚ done send message message get kind amplification powerful political leader think that‚ kind important dynamic I‚ sure would attribute causal mechanism feedback loop happening michelle goldberg piece feel like Trump‚ election convinced people convinced white nationalist much wider support they‚ realized Right mean think terrorist act sense they‚ acting behalf greater silent population poll recently show something like 19 percent people believe Trump opposes white nationalism tell large number supporter believe Trump fact oppose white nationalism feel like you‚ willing take kind step believe people behind believe you‚ going kind support even sort catalytic effect you‚ going spark sort uprising ross douthat think I‚ closer Jamelle‚ take Michelle‚ think right way understand Trump yeah he‚ someone doesn‚ give shit white nationalism president United States powerful office lot cultural influence undoubtedly toxic effect culture kind role spreading idea making seem credible think calling Trump white nationalist sort analytic mistake mean we‚ discussion count white nationalism think imputes level ideology doesn‚ think it‚ reasonable call sort bigot racist white nationalist guess I‚ put way think thing would happening without Donald Trump think conversation

1945 present slow motion collapse race hierarchy least slow motion collapse race hierarchy explicit form lot thing happening reaction look Trump like Ross said epiphenomenon entire career right Like someone who‚ casual bigotry casual racism acted racism kind make curiosity first national life time go becomes part public persona also it‚ hard say Trump wasn‚ much would happening year actually week Trump announced campaign Dylann Roof killed nine people Charleston Right Sort like kind violence precedes Trump planning Trump feel like I‚ willing say causal relationship like Trump‚ campaign style disregard willingness elevate people kind adjacent world ‚ borrow terminology last decade politics ‚ aid comfort enemy Right I‚ sure it‚ causal david leonhardt Let‚ end I‚ interested thought quickly think play American public point Trump obviously think still play well mean ran closing week midterm campaign basically running would describe kind white nationalist message much think actually help heading 2020 hurt point Jamelle jamelle bouie It‚ always easier start like baseline view thing baseline view thing Trump could somehow stop talking November 2020 win election Right Like background
